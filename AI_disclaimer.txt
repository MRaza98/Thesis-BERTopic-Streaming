Major parts of the code in this repository were developed with assistance from Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic), a GenAI model.

Specifically, the low level detailed syntax of the following were done with the assistance of AI:

1. Functions around coherence models
2. Boilerplate code to read and output csv files
3. General I/O
4. General improvements and critical feedback
5. Code reiterations or adaptations from one experiment to another

This enabled the author to quickly iterate and experiment over new parameters and conduct detailed
exploratory analyses to understand the behaviour of BERTopic.
