they are being held back through no fault of their own, and as a result our country is being held back. so we need to act to help people and address the fact that we simply need to build more homes. this government understand that and understand what is needed : more homes of the right type and quality and in the right places. we must ensure that they are affordable and that the housing market works for all parts of our community. we are making good progress on housing supply. we have delivered over 1. 1 million homes since 2010. in 2016 - 17 some 217, 350 new homes were delivered, the highest number in all but one of the last 30 years. since 2013 we have helped over 158, 000 households on to the housing ladder through our help to buy equity loan, and 81 % of them were first - time buyers."", ""it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for grantham and stamford ( nick boles ), although i did not agree with everything he said. he and i know each other very well, and it is good to see him back in the house. we constantly hear the same lines about the government promising to fix the housing market, yet after their seven years in government, it is no secret that we still have an enormous housing crisis in this country. last year, the number of affordable homes built in this country fell to the lowest level in 24 years. new policies introduced by this government have weakened the previous labour government ' s brownfield - first policy. in fact, under this government, as of july 2017, 425, 000 homes were planned to be built on green - belt land. that represents the biggest yearly increase in proposed development on green - belt land for two decades. to add insult to injury, since 2009, only 16 % of houses built on green - belt land outside local plans were deemed affordable. it is worth pointing out that under the previous labour government, 2 million more homes were built and we had 1 million more householders owning their own homes, but since 2010, under this government, the number of homeowners aged under 45 has fallen by 900, 000. there was also the biggest investment in social housing for a generation. on average, labour councils have built around 50 % more homes than tory councils since 2010. it is clear that the government ' s housing and planning act 2016 fails to get to grips with the crisis of home ownership. it is simply no good trying to twist this around and placing the blame on those in local government. if that were true, coventry ' s local plan would not have been approved by this government."", 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr hanson. i congratulate the hon. member for ealing north ( stephen pound ) on securing this important debate. i welcome the wide - ranging discussion and recognise many of the concerns about the impact of houses in multiple occupation, or hmos, in certain areas. i thought it would be helpful if i set out clearly the wide range of housing and planning controls that exist to control both the creation and operation of hmos. i hope this will demonstrate that local authorities have an effective array of tools to ensure that any adverse impacts from hmos can be properly addressed. before discussing those controls in detail, it is important to acknowledge the wider context : the pressing national need to increase the supply of all types of housing. as we set out in the housing white paper, the government are determined to boost the supply of housing and, over the longer term, create a more efficient housing market where outcomes more closely match the needs of all households. our actions are already delivering success. since 2010, we have delivered more than 357, 000 new affordable homes, and around one quarter of them are in london. the prime minister recently announced an additional a£2 billion funding for affordable housing, which will increase the affordable homes programme budget to over a£9 billion. the new funding will support councils and housing associations to build more affordable homes where they are needed most - where families are struggling with rental costs, and some are at risk of homelessness. but there is more to do. the government recently published a revision of the national planning policy framework for consultation, which implements around 80 reforms announced last year. it will ensure that planning remains locally led and that all local communities get the homes and infrastructure they need. it represents an ambitious step forward in our aim to tackle the housing crisis by bringing forward more land for housing in the right places.']"

the same number of respondents also reported a significant increase in the number of litigants in person in family cases. most worryingly, however, 25 % of respondents had stopped doing civil legal aid work, and 48 % of barristers surveyed did less legal aid work than before. we know about legal aid deserts popping up across the country. almost one third of the legal aid areas in england and wales have one local legal aid housing advice provider, or none. laspo has shunned those who most need help.', 'the hon. lady is right - others have also called for that. that is why the government are undertaking a review, which has started and which i will come to, in relation to legal aid funding and the legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders act 2012 generally, but more particularly and more relevant in this case, in relation to legal aid funding for inquests. i have identified the two circumstances where legal aid was sought and granted in this case. the third, which is what the debate centres on, is the provision of legal aid for judicial review. legal aid is available for judicial review in generic terms. however, as with legal aid for inquests, this availability is subject to a number of restrictions. applicants must satisfy statutory tests for their means and merits in order to qualify for legal aid for judicial review. the reason that they are required to satisfy those tests is to ensure that the resources that are available for legal aid generally are given to those who are most in need. in the case in question, which was an application for funding for a judicial review, the legal aid agency determined that those requirements were not met. i fully appreciate that the families have found that decision of the legal aid agency very frustrating. the hon. member for ashfield ( gloria de piero ) asked whether i can review that decision, but it is important to point out that funding decisions are made by the legal aid agency independently of ministers. i am not privy to the details of the decision. the decision whether to provide legal aid funding in an individual case should not be a political one. it is solely for the director of the legal aid casework at the legal aid agency to decide whether a case is within the regulations and the laws that parliament has set. i was not aware of the reasons why legal aid was determined - that is a decision of the legal aid agency independent of ministers.', ""before i turn to the particular instances that affect the hon. lady ' s halifax constituency, it is important to make a number of broad points about access to justice and the courts estate. in every sector, digitalisation is improving access to services, including to public services. technology has reformed the way that we live our lives and made many processes more efficient. in such circumstances, we ask ourselves whether justice should be immune from digital advancement. in 2015, the civil justice council wrote a report, stating that online dispute resolution had enormous potential to bring two great benefits to our justice system : a lower - cost court system and an increase in access to justice. the ministry of justice is now in the process of improving and upgrading our justice system to bring it up to date in the 21st century. technology is not the only answer to any upgrade. the provision of justice depends on people and courts and on lawyers and judges. however, in circumstances in which 41 % of courts in 2016 - 17 were used at less than half of their available hearing capacity ; in circumstances in which the money from the proceeds of the sale of a court are put back into the justice system ; in circumstances in which we are spending a£1 billion on our courts reform programme ; and in circumstances in which finances are not unlimited, we do need to ask ourselves where money on the justice system is best spent. it is in that context that the closure of the courts in calderdale took place. the closures of the county and magistrates courts were proposed because they were poorly used. for example, in the financial year before the consultation, the magistrates court had been used for 33 % of its available hours. both the magistrates court and the county court were also grade ii listed buildings and not fit for purpose. the court consultation resulted in a proposal to move the work to bradford, where better facilities were available for those using the courts.""]"

in breast cancer awareness month, with a new cancer strategy announced by the prime minister at her recent party conference and while the long - term economic plan for the nhs is being decided. this is an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that the way in which we prevent, diagnose and treat breast cancer, and care for those who have it, truly benefits all patients in every part of the country. every year about 55, 000 people in the uk are diagnosed with breast cancer, making it the most common cancer in the country. one in eight women in the uk will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, and nearly 11, 500 women and 80 men in the uk still lose their lives to breast cancer each year. progress has been made, but survival outcomes vary significantly between regions across the country, and britain continues to trail other european countries on breast cancer survival. as members can imagine, that sort of statistic hits home with me.', 'it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for bosworth ( david tredinnick ), who made an interesting speech. i also thank the hon. member for east kilbride, strathaven and lesmahagow ( dr cameron ) for securing this important debate. we all know someone who has had, or has been affected by, cancer. my family is no exception : both my parents had cancer and my husband lives with cancer every day of his life, and i could talk about cancer forever - but, madam deputy speaker, i will try to limit myself to the recommended time. the cancer strategy sets out strategic priorities and recommendations that aim to improve radically the outcomes that the nhs delivers for people affected by cancer, yet we also know that the specific needs of blood cancer patients are not being fully met by the cancer strategy. that is primarily because the experience of blood cancer patients is different from that of solid tumour cancer patients, so general cancer services are not always effective in meeting their needs. these unmet needs occur in a number of priority areas identified in the cancer strategy, including awareness and early diagnosis, patient experience, living with and beyond cancer, access to new treatments and research, and nhs commissioning. today, i want to focus on one particular issue : the need to improve post stem cell transplant care for blood cancer patients. this issue overlaps with a number of the aforementioned priority areas : patient experience, living with and beyond cancer, and nhs commissioning. it is estimated that by 2020 there will be more than 16, 000 people in the uk living post transplant, many of whom will be experiencing both physical and psychological side - effects from their treatment which can last for months or even years. the side - effects can include graft versus host disease, second cancers, infertility, depression, isolation and post - traumatic stress disorder.', 'it is an absolute pleasure to see my hon. friend in his place. long may he stay there. cancer is, understandably, a very emotional topic. one in two people in the uk will be affected by cancer in their lifetimes, and, as we have heard from almost everyone who has spoken today, we have all been affected in some way ourselves. when my children were very small, i lost my mother - in - law to breast cancer. that is one of the reasons why i joined the all - party parliamentary group on breast cancer, and i am vice - chair of the group to this day. it is this emotion that encourages us and gets us all to come together to tackle cancer. over the years, there has been a steady improvement in cancer survival rates in england. however, we still lag behind the improvements of our european counterparts, and the number of new cancer cases continues to rise year on year. if these trends continue, it is estimated that by 2020 some 2. 4 million people in england will have had a cancer diagnosis at some point in their life. that is why the government must take urgent steps so that cancer diagnosis care and outcomes in england can be improved. the cancer strategy was a welcome step forward to achieving the best cancer care and outcomes in the world, and labour is fully committed to delivering, and helping to deliver, that strategy in full. however, as has been mentioned, there are some concerns across the house about the progress of the strategy. i am pleased that some of the targets have already been met, but i am under no illusions - many are no closer to being reached than they were almost three years ago.']"

indeed, in this debate i do not seek to suggest anything at all about cannabis, frankly. in fact, i want to make the point that the two - cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids - are not comparable and that these psychoactive drugs are not the same thing at all. we need to stop treating cannabis and synthetic cannabis as if they are the same thing, and we need to reclassify synthetic cannabis.', ""i, personally, and the government sympathise deeply with the situation faced by alfie dingley and his family. i think that everyone on both sides of the house and outside it will understand and respect the desire of the family to try to alleviate his suffering in any way possible. i assure my hon. friend that we want to help to find a solution within the existing regulations. as my hon. friend will know, the current situation is that cannabis, in its raw form, is not recognised in the uk as having any medicinal benefits. it is therefore listed as a schedule 1 drug under the misuse of drugs regulations 2001. this means that it is unlawful to produce, supply or possess raw cannabis unless it is for the purposes of research. products must be thoroughly tested in the uk to provide the necessary assurances of their efficacy, quality and safety. we have a clear regime in place that is administered by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency to enable medicines, including those containing controlled drugs such as cannabis, to be developed, licensed and made available for medicinal use to patients in the uk, as happened in the case of sativex, as my hon. friend knows. the home office will consider issuing a licence to enable trials of any new medicine under schedule 1 to the misuse of drugs regulations 2001, providing that it complies with appropriate ethical approvals. cannabis - based products should be treated in the same way as all other drugs, meaning that they should go through the normal testing procedures applied to any other medicines. the current situation is that outside of research we would not issue licences for the personal consumption of cannabis because it is listed as a schedule 1 drug. however, we are aware of differing approaches in other countries and continue to monitor the world health organisation ' s expert committee on drug dependence, which has committed to reviewing the use of medicinal cannabis.""]"

one of the many effects of the housing crisis is the sheer amount of people now forced into the private rented sector. it is for this reason that i am adamant that we must improve conditions for renters. the liberal democrats have fought long for renters ' rights, so i welcome and support this bill. it is vital that we in westminster ensure that tenants ' fees are abolished because of the transient nature of the private rented sector, particularly for young people. however, the housing crisis has also pushed many families into renting and, as we heard earlier, the leading cause of homelessness is the ending of a private rented sector tenancy. while rental costs continue to spiral, people are becoming trapped. they cannot afford their rent, but nor can they afford to move because of the myriad administrative fees. we must ensure that the bill fully ends the practice of tenants ' fees. however, as the bill is currently drafted, there are still loopholes around default fees. the secretary of state ' s amendments go some way towards closing the gap, and ensuring that letting agents and landlords do not introduce new fees under a different name. however, the text of the bill is still too ambiguous, leaving what constitutes a reasonable cost to the discretion of landlords or letting agents. we must also provide local authorities with appropriate funding to enforce the ban. if local authorities have no resources to enforce it, landlords and letting agents will just continue with this unreasonable practice. i urge the secretary of state to listen to the concerns raised today. otherwise he will undermine legislation that could really make a difference to people ' s lives. there is little merit in introducing legislation with obvious loopholes that allow individuals to continue with a practice that we want to stop."", ""i congratulate the secretary of state on his appointment and welcome my hon. friend the member for croydon central ( sarah jones ) to our housing team. this tenant fees legislation is very welcome. we know that the majority of landlords are good landlords, or strive to be, and understand the expectations upon them before they embark on becoming a landlord. however, a number of rogue landlords and letting agents give the sector a bad name, undermine the good work of quality agents and landlords, and they have squeezed tenants for cash in unfair ways, with disproportionate charges for unjustifiable reasons. it is right that the government are acting to change this unfair system and labour welcomes that, but it would be remiss of me to fail to remind the house that we first suggested a move to ban letting fees back in 2013. after five years, it is good that the government are finally acting on this issue. if we get the bill right, it will have a positive impact on people ' s lives on a day - to - day basis. the overriding purpose of the legislation is to help to shift the balance of power from unscrupulous agents and landlords towards decent tenants - to make renting fairer, more affordable and more transparent and to give tenants greater clarity and control over what they pay. we will all have heard horror stories of agents or landlords charging people excessive fees to secure properties, or throughout tenancies, imposing additional charges with excessively high administration fees. with fewer social properties available, this places great difficulties on those with low incomes, or those who are renting alone or simply cannot afford thousands of pounds in up - front fees.""]"

led government, has dramatically reduced the amount of plastic bags in use : by 83 %. about 9 billion fewer plastic bags have been used since the introduction of that simple 5p charge. the government have brought forward a comprehensive 25 - year plan for the environment, including measures to look at reducing plastic waste and disposing of waste more responsibly. that should be welcomed. i want to join the many environmental groups that are calling for an introduction of plastic - free aisles and products in our supermarkets.', ""the reality is that until now, china, turkey, malaysia, indonesia, vietnam and other countries have largely been happy to accept our plastic because they have seen it as a raw material that they can use to generate more products. plastic recycling is technically possible and exists in this country already - it is just that it is not as economical. people have to pay to recycle various sources of plastic rather than getting a benefit from them, although that is changing. we recognise that china has reduced the amount of contamination that it is prepared to accept in plastic - it does not ignore all plastic, but effectively it has closed the market and made it less worth while. i am sure my hon. friend is eagerly awaiting our strategy on resources and waste, which will appear in due course. perhaps more can be revealed at that time. i mentioned the measures in the 25 - year environment plan we published in january, as well as the government ' s commitment to taking action against the problem of single - use plastics waste as part of our wider strategy. we have given a£20 million to the plastics innovation fund, which is co - ordinated by innovate uk and the engineering and physical sciences research council, and which aims to reduce the environmental costs of plastic and litter. i am pleased to say that, in the budget, we announced not only a tax on plastic products that are not at least 30 % recycled, but a further a£20 million of funding : a£10 million extra for r & d and a£10 million to pioneer innovative approaches to boosting recycling and reducing litter. the fund will be made available during the 2019 - 20 financial year. i agree with my hon. friend the member for north cornwall that innovation is vital in supporting developments to tackle plastic waste, so we will continue to explore commercially viable options."", ""i agree with the hon. gentleman that complexity is part of the challenge. supermarkets can help by ensuring that as much as possible of the plastic packaging they use is recyclable, and that if it is not, it is clearly labelled accordingly. that would help households and consumers to make informed decisions. consumers are key to the process. the government can perhaps do more to reduce plastic waste from food packaging, but ultimately consumers will drive change by making informed choices and by making the responsible choice - whenever they are given a choice - of the option with the least amount of packaging, and of plastic - free packaging if possible. many supermarkets have sought to take action. i believe that much of that has been driven by consumer choice and by consumers ' desire to reduce the amount of plastic packaging, and we should welcome that. in september, lidl announced that it would cease to use black plastic packaging on fruit and vegetable products by the end of that month. as we know, recycling black plastic is challenging. morrisons, the fourth - largest uk supermarket chain, announced in april that it will bring back traditional brown paper bags for its fruit and veg aisle as part of a range of measures to cut plastic waste. i am sure many of us read the reports over the weekend that a north london supermarket is the first independent supermarket in the country to introduce plastic - free aisles, and is now calling on others to follow its lead. there are signs that retailers are starting to get the message that consumers want less plastic waste from their food packaging. i encourage all consumers who feel strongly about this matter to continue to drive home that message. i believe that there is a role for the government, but most of the change will come from the consumer. the introduction of the 5p charge for plastic bags shows that the government can nudge people to make the right choices.""]"

by and large, these are very straightforward claims. we want to ensure that support is there so that people are able to bring the claims in person. as i have said, these are simple claims and it is right that we also take action to address some of the concerns that we have. i shall set out more detail in my remarks, but i believe that we have the balance right in terms of the increase to a£5, 000. the bill provides that the tariff will be set in regulations to be debated via the affirmative procedure by parliament following royal assent. we are committed to tabling an amendment in committee that will require the lord chancellor to consult with the lord chief justice before making those regulations. the judiciary will have discretion to increase the compensation payable in exceptional circumstances and, after listening to the views in the other place, we have amended the bill to ensure that overall compensation levels in the tariff are reviewed at least every three years. we listened carefully to the comments made by the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee in the lords. we accepted its recommendation and tabled an amendment to include a full definition of whiplash injury in the bill in order to remove any ambiguity about what that constitutes in law. the government ' s reform programme also includes measures - not included in the scope of this bill - to increase the small claims track limit for road traffic accident personal injury claims to a£5, 000, and for all other personal injury claims to a£2, 000. as these claims are generally not complicated, they are suitable to be managed in the simpler, lower cost small claims track. this route is designed to be accessible to litigants in person without the need for a lawyer, although claimants may still seek legal representation if they wish."", 'my hon. friend is right to raise both points. i come back to the fact that the cma looked at this area and concluded that this is a competitive one. the history suggests that these benefits are passed on, but we are strengthening the bill and will bring forward amendments very shortly that will enable us all to hold those insurance companies to account. many claims involving road traffic accidents will, of course, be genuine. it is absolutely right that they are compensated appropriately. our reforms are focused on ensuring that genuine claimants have access to justice, receive a proportionate amount of compensation and that the system works for all who use it honestly. however, with major improvements in motoring safety in recent years, including the increased use of integrated seat and head restraints, it would be remiss of the government not to ask what is going wrong. the reality is that some of these claims are not genuine. in 2017, the insurance industry identified almost 70, 000 motor insurance claims that it considered to be fraudulent. as the learned lord hope of craighead noted in the other place, it is necessary to do something to try to minimise the abuse that has given rise to such a large and disproportionate number of claims. the knock - on effect of all these claims is increased insurance premiums, particularly for young people and the elderly. as members across the house will know, for many people, owning a car is not a luxury, but a necessity. that is especially true of those in rural communities, but it does affect all our constituents. that is why we have pledged in our manifesto to tackle these costs. taken together, the whiplash measures proposed by the government could result in savings of around a£1. 1 billion a year. around 85 % of the uk motor and liability insurance market have publicly committed to pass on those savings to consumers.', 'it is a pleasure to be able to speak in this debate on the second reading of the civil liability bill, which brings forward changes that are of great importance to the insurance industry. i am pleased to hear that there has been significant engagement between industry and government over this essential legislation. ageas insurance, for example, is one of the largest providers in the uk, employing more than 400 people in my constituency, and it has communicated to me its enthusiastic support for these changes, shared by the vast majority of the public. these measures will help to reduce motor insurance premiums for insurance customers by adjusting how the personal injury discount rate is set. alongside this, the introduction of a new tariff will specifically target exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims that have driven up insurance premiums for hard - working households in places such as stoke - on - trent. a new fixed compensation level for whiplash injury will be created, putting provisions in place for the court to uplift the compensation available in exceptional circumstances, compared with a final compensation figure being negotiated by the parties involved, as is currently the case. the compensation culture that has been created, with huge levels of unjustified claims for things like whiplash, saw premiums rise at the fastest rate ever last year. increases of about 10 % a year are totally unmanageable and unaffordable for motorists. these changes must be brought about to reduce the price all motorists are having to pay to compensate unreasonably high levels of claims. clearly, it is important that these savings are passed on to consumers. i am pleased to hear that the abi, which represents 93 % of the motor insurance market, has written to the lord chancellor emphasising its commitment to this.']"

the government clearly recognise the flaws in their argument. when pushed, they claim that voter identification is designed to tackle the perception of electoral fraud. however, new research published today by the electoral reform society shows that mandatory id in polling stations is one of voters ' lowest concerns - just 4 % of voters believe id is the most important priority for our democracy. the top issues for voters were : ensuring that elections are free from the influence of large financial donations, an accurate voting register and balanced media coverage."", ""the british public deserve to have confidence in our democracy. there is clearly the potential for electoral fraud in our system and that undermines confidence and promotes perceptions of vulnerability. when fraud is committed in elections, it is not a victimless crime ; people ' s votes are stolen or someone is elected who should not have been elected. earlier this year, the government announced that they would be conducting pilots for voter identification at the local elections in may this year in line with our manifesto commitment to legislate to ensure that a form of id must be presented before voting. voter id is part of the government ' s commitment to improve the security and the resilience of the electoral system that underpins our democracy and will promote greater confidence in our democratic processes. in making these changes, we will bring our electoral system in line with others such as that in northern ireland or canada, which operate successful programmes, and recognise that there is an increasing expectation that someone ' s vote should be protected and carefully guarded. we already ask that people prove who they are in order to claim benefits, to rent a car or even to collect a parcel from the post office, so this is a proportionate and reasonable approach. democracy is precious and it is right to take that more robust approach to protect the integrity of the electoral process. the independent electoral commission has, since 2014, pushed for the introduction of id to strengthen the system, and it has welcomed the voter id pilots as a positive first step towards implementing its own recommendation that an accessible, proportionate voter identification scheme should be introduced in great britain. in a recent report for democratic audit uk, academic stuart wilks - heeg stated that, after the scheme was introduced in northern ireland, there was no evidence to suggest a fall in turnout, but that there was plenty of evidence that fraud declined sharply.""]"

value tariffs. that will help to protect the 11 million households on low standard variable or default tariffs who are not protected by existing caps. as hon. members have said, the difference between the cheapest tariff and the average standard variable tariff from a big six supplier is about a£300 a year, and it has been at about that level for the past six months. that is an awful lot of money for constituents in some of the poorest parts of our region, as well as others in the uk. the competition and markets authority ' s recent investigation into the energy market found that the domestic customers of the big six energy suppliers pay on average a£1. 4 billion a year more than they would in a truly competitive market. i do not think that there is any argument in the house about the fact that the market is not truly competitive. although i believe that promoting competition is generally the most effective way to ensure that customers receive the best value in their service, i welcome the fact that the government are prepared to act when it becomes apparent that markets are not working for consumers. as colleagues have said, the technological advances that will improve the market are not happening fast enough to support vulnerable people now. the government made a manifesto commitment to extend the price protection that is currently in place."", 'quite unsettling, yes. i believe that pressing for an absolute cap over a relative one is the right way to go. as the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee stated, a relative cap could force cheaper energy tariffs to disappear, harming consumers, not protecting them. that would run counter to the sentiment of the bill. as we have heard, ofgem will be given the task of making the cap work effectively with its formula and will be responsible for setting the cap and reviewing it every six months. as outlined by my hon. friend the member for weston - super - mare ( john penrose ), it is beholden on ofgem to get this right and hold people to account, otherwise it will not have been worth while. it is vital that energy companies do not take advantage of any price cap and lift their tariffs to the maximum allowed. as i mentioned earlier, the energy sector needs more price competition to encourage lower prices, and an absolute cap can help to achieve this. i am delighted that the government will require the gas and electricity markets authority to protect consumers beyond the end of the energy price cap. energy companies must not slip back into their old habits as soon as the cap is lifted, putting ordinary people back in the position they were in before the cap and leaving them paying over the odds. the bill will ensure better value for money for many people who, frankly, have been taken for a ride and been paying over the odds for the self same energy that the person down the road has been getting cheaper. as the minister stated, it cannot be fair that between 2012 and 2015 customers paid a£1. 4 billion more than they ought to have done. in 2016, this escalated to an incredible a£2 billion. as i have said before, many of these people fall into the a€œvulnerablea€ category.']"

how will a university know when it is dealing with the regulator, a funding council or the voice of government? it is that final point that will be concerning to many universities and students, who worry that, far from acting as a voice for students to the government - i ask as the minister chunters away - the office for students will be the opposite : the government demanding a voice on to students. for instance, the minister wants the office for students to stop no - platform policies that ban hate groups from student unions. this seems to be a solution in search of a problem. perhaps he can explain why he believes that he and the board of the office for students should use their resources to interfere at this level.']"

fundamentally, as i laid out at the beginning of my speech, this is a problem that exists in many of our local prisons. it is not an issue that specifically exists in cat d prisons, or in the high security estate, or particularly in the female estate. this is an issue in prisons such as bedford, exeter, nottingham and liverpool, and, as we discovered, birmingham. what is the solution? the shadow secretary of state asks whether the question is a private / public question. it is not an ideological question. two of the best local prisons currently in the country, forest bank and thameside, are private prisons. bedford is, of course, a public prison. he asked whether we would look at the ratio between prison officers and prisoners, and rightly pointed out that in birmingham, as in other prisons, when we face these kinds of problems, often we temporarily reduce prisoner numbers and bring in additional prison officers. i can undertake that that is something we will be examining during the 28 days we have ; we will prepare a plan and come forward with an answer for the chief inspector. it is a very reasonable proposal, and it is one we will consider very carefully.', ""the chief inspector of prisons has spoken of the continual and unchecked decline in standards at the prison over the past nine years. he also said that, at times, it felt like the prisoners were in control. this is the prison with the highest rate of assaults in the country. some 77 % of prison officers at hmp bedford have less than one year ' s service. that is the reality, so i am disappointed that, in his seven minutes, the minister said a lot but avoided the specific question at hand on hmp bedford. i thank my hon. friend the member for bedford ( mohammad yasin ) for his tireless work on exposing the failings at the prison. as we have heard, this is the fourth jail in just 12 months to be issued an urgent notification. formally, the minister has to publish a plan of action for the prison within 28 days, but we need answers today. the government ' s recent solution to the widespread failure at hmp birmingham was to increase prison staff and reduce prisoner numbers there. will the minister commit today to a similar increase in staff and reduction in prisoner numbers at bedford? there was a riot at bedford in november 2016. what have the government done since to improve the situation, bearing in mind what the chief inspector of prisons has said? whose fault is it that in the latest annual performance figures, hmp bedford is still labelled as a prison of serious concern? it remains one of the most overcrowded prisons in the country - 40 % over capacity. what has the minister done, and what have the government done, to tackle overcrowding there since the 2016 riot? more widely, what plans do the government have to end overcrowding across the prison estate, given that over half of prisons are overcrowded?""]"

it is happening across mainland europe, too. according to data from the house of commons library, by the end of 2016, the number of bank branches in germany had fallen to something like 32, 000, which was a reduction of nearly 6 % on the year before. in france, where there has been more robust opposition to branch closures - apparently, it is more difficult to close branches in france than elsewhere - socia©ta© ga©na©rale has announced the closure of 20 % of its branch network by 2020. that bank is going to close one in five branches. however, the french bank branch network is still extensive, with six branches per 10, 000 head of population, which i believe is the highest proportion in the eu. in spain, 10, 000 branches were closed between 2012 and 2016. banking is changing, driven by technology that is obviously convenient to the vast majority of customers. i would like the minister to address two areas of concern. first, what more can the government do and what work are they undertaking with the financial sector to encourage banks to look after their vulnerable customers so that they are not left behind? there is also a wider concern.']"

how is it that the government still do not know how many private tower blocks are unsafe? how is it that only seven out of more than 300 tower blocks across the country with the same grenfell - style cladding have had it removed and replaced?

i hope the minister will be able to respond to my points. first, as ever, i must raise the issue of how the law deals with drivers who cause death through dangerous or careless driving. as many hon. members present will know, in october 2017, following a consultation, the ministry of justice announced a series of changes to the law on death by dangerous and careless driving, including life sentences for those who cause death by dangerous driving and for careless drivers who kill while under the influence of drink or drugs, as well as a new offence of causing serious injury through careless driving. the government now claim that those changes will be incorporated into a review of cycle safety. i have to say that that is completely unacceptable. it is right that the government review cycle laws, but it is just not good enough that the changes already announced to sentencing are being rolled into an open - ended process.', ""it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for redditch ( rachel maclean ). road safety is an issue that i repeatedly raise in the house, and i welcome the opportunity to debate it in the chamber this evening. we all know what a vital issue it is, and it affects many of our constituents, often tragically. in west yorkshire, 815 people were killed or seriously injured in road traffic incidents last year. in my constituency, more children are killed or seriously injured on our roads than almost anywhere else in the country. i know that it is ambitious, but we should aim to eliminate road deaths and serious injuries entirely in the uk. vision zero seeks to do exactly that, and i urge the government to look into that approach. clearly we will need a wide variety of tools in order to achieve that, and one crucial part is a tougher criminal justice approach. it was for this reason that i warmly welcomed the government ' s announcement in october 2017 that they would bring in longer sentences for drivers who killed through dangerous or careless driving, as well as the announcement of a new offence of causing serious injury through careless driving. i pay tribute to all those who campaigned for this change, including the road safety charity brake, but we are now over a year on, and the government have still not delivered on their commitment. in fact, we are no closer to those changes being made. ministers are now claiming that the changes will be incorporated into a review of cycle safety, but i have to say that that is completely unacceptable. it is right, of course, that the government should look at the laws around cycling in order to make it safer for all road users, but it is not good enough that already - announced changes on sentencing are being rolled into the open - ended process.""]"

sided approach, but one of the most important things that can be done is to integrate information about donation into the formal curriculum, which the review recommends. we already know that education works. for example, anthony nolan and other blood disorder charities have had great success working with schools, universities and colleges across the uk. just last month, i wrote a letter to all schools with a sixth form in or near my constituency to ask whether they would consider using an assembly or personal, social, health and economic lessons to teach students about the importance of donating stem cells, blood and organs. i am delighted that one of the schools has already agreed to do so. since the hero project started in 2009, more than 32, 000 people have signed up to the anthony nolan stem cell donor register, and approximately 16 % of them are from a bame background. the hero project recognises that the different religious views about organ donation are one of the barriers preventing people from signing up to the organ donation register. anthony nolan and other blood disorder charities recognise and respect those diverse views and tailor their message to suit different interpretations of faith. they focus on what people can do to help, not on what they cannot do. the review found that the three main barriers that prevent people from signing up are a lack of knowledge or awareness, religious permissibility and a lack of trust in medical institutions. the opt - out system for organ and tissue donation, with additional safeguards, is welcome, but there must be an awareness campaign that is mindful of the cultural sensitivities relating to organ donation and addresses the significant pressure on nhs blood and transplant ' s capacity to accommodate any rise in organ donations."", 'that is correct. as someone said earlier, we do not like talking about this stuff, although we should be talking about it more. if the bill provides us with such an opportunity, that is another reason why it needs to be welcomed. although three people a day die from a lack of suitable organs, the situation is worse among people from the bame community who are more likely to suffer from illnesses that require an organ transplant. the national bame transplant alliance has highlighted that issue, and said in its submission that consent to organ donation must be increased among ethnic minority communities, because transplants are more likely to be successful when the donated organ is a closer match to the recipient. sadly, however, within that community there is a lack of organs available for donation. that has to do with many issues, including a lack of willingness - perhaps for cultural reasons - to discuss the issue within the family, or perhaps a lack of access to knowledge about the way that the organ donation system works. there are a number of issues, but is simply iniquitous that the bame community should suffer more, for whatever reason, and that is why the bill is so welcome and necessary.', ""i thank my hon. friend the member for coventry north west ( mr robinson ) for introducing this important private member ' s bill. the nhs has just reached the historic milestone of 70 years. as a country and as a society, we are proud of the landmark advances we have made within that time. because of advances in organ donation and transplantation, 50, 000 people are alive today. most people are willing to donate their organs after they die, but only 36 % of the population are on the organ donation register. organ donation is increasing gradually, but sadly it is not keeping pace with the number of people on the transplant waiting list. the british heart foundation highlights the fact that an average of three people per day die in need of an organ. as someone who was a cardiac nurse in a previous job, i am only too aware of how desperate a patient can become when waiting for an organ to become available. i saw at first hand the distress that people suffered while waiting for a heart transplant or for another organ. in spain and belgium, a softer opt - out approach has facilitated a cultural change that has generated higher donor rates. that is why i am here today supporting my hon. friend ' s bill, which will address this bleak statistic and bring the discussion of organ donation back to the dinner tables of families across the uk. i also express my sincere thanks to the daily mirror for its campaign in support of the bill, which has shown the public the gift of life that is given by those who donate organs. one organ donor can transform as many as nine people ' s lives. as has been mentioned, the uk has one of the lowest family consent rates in europe. in wales, the welsh government bravely introduced deemed consent.""]"

party consensus on the need for increased transparency of parole board decisions. that should not undermine parole board independence, which is important. i hope to move swiftly to change systems in order to ensure that the reasons that the parole board has reached a decision become available to the victims. i hope that that will be in place shortly. the hon. gentleman touched on the licence conditions. in a way, this is not necessarily as much of an issue as it was. it had been determined that worboys would be electronically tagged and excluded from london. that may or may not be an issue in the future, depending on future parole board decisions. on the dossier that was provided by the national probation service - and, therefore, my department - for the hearing that occurred on 8 november last year, it is the case that there may well have been information that should have been included in the dossier and that was not provided, but it is worth pointing out that it is the responsibility of the parole board to satisfy itself that an offender is no longer a risk to the public. the judgment of sir brian leveson was that the parole board failed to probe that evidence sufficiently, as it should have done. i reiterate that the national probation service opposed the release of john worboys. i made no secret of the fact that i was considering whether to take a judicial review, and i set out in my earlier remarks the reasons why i did not bring that forward. the reality was that the victims were in a better position than me to bring a successful case. it is important that we ensure that when the parole board reaches a conclusion that meets certain criteria, there is an ability for it to look again and examine whether the relevant panel has performed its duties as it should have done.', ""i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement on today ' s high court decision. today ' s unprecedented ruling, made possible by the human rights act, clearly highlights the deep flaws in the initial parole board decision. that initial decision clearly caused anguish for the victims - those whose cases have been dealt with - and also for those who have not yet had justice. in addition, there has been deep concern among women and the public more widely. the head of the parole board has decided to stand down, but what is needed is real change in the way that the parole board functions. the current legal restrictions on the parole board mean that we do not know why the initial decision was taken. that led to a rumour about where worboys would be released, and even a rumour about his being released without a tag. that is not good for victims, and it is not good for public confidence. it cannot be right that women victims had to go to judicial review before the reasons for the release of john worboys became available. we also remember the government making the victims go to the supreme court to secure compensation following police failings. judges in the judicial review said that too much secrecy about parole board decisions under rule 25 of parole board proceedings prevents any reasons from being given for decisions made by the board. therefore, as has been mentioned, the worboys ' case underlines once and for all that there is a need for the government to take urgent action and urgent measures to guarantee greater transparency in parole board decisions. given that the public are entitled to be informed about court judgments, they must also be entitled to be informed about the clear reasons behind parole board decisions. of course, this is not about undermining the independence of the parole board, and we on the labour benches will defend the independence of our judiciary."", ""with permission, mr speaker, i wish to make a statement on the high court judgment handed down this morning in the case relating to the parole board ' s decision to release john radford, formerly known as john worboys. this is an important and unprecedented case. the president of the queen ' s bench division, sir brian leveson, the most senior judge who heard this case, said that it is wholly exceptional. it is the first time that a parole board decision to release a prisoner has been challenged, and the first time that the rules on the non - disclosure of parole board decisions have been called into question. the judgment quashes the parole board ' s decision to release worboys and finds that rule 25 of the parole board rules is unlawful. this means that worboys ' case will now be resubmitted to the parole board. a new panel will be constituted, and updated evidence on his risk from prison and probation professionals will be provided. the panel will then assess anew whether worboys is suitable for release. those victims covered by the victim contact scheme will be fully informed and involved in this process. my department also has to reformulate the parole board ' s rules to allow more transparency around decision making and reasoning. it is clear that there was widespread concern about the decision by the parole board to release worboys. as i have previously told the house, i share those concerns and, consequently, i welcome this judgment. i congratulate the victims who brought the judicial review and reiterate my heartfelt sympathy for all victims who have suffered as a result of worboys ' hideous crimes. i want to set out, in greater detail than i have previously been able to set out, the reasons why i did not bring a judicial review.""]"

the services that children in need relied on - have fallen prey to the government ' s austerity programme and are disappearing. in that environment, in any organisation, the roles and responsibilities that have the weight of legislation behind them - the things that absolutely must be done - are always the ones that take prominence. there is no legal requirement for local authorities to continue to support children in need when they turn 18, so it should come as no surprise that those children, on the cusp of adulthood, fall into the abyss. looking at the current figures for 16 and 17 - year - olds classed as children in need, that means that approximately 58, 000 children are being cast adrift."", ""i was going to mention the point made by the hon. member for redcar ( anna turley ) on kinship carers. i acknowledge the work that they do. as the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) mentioned, we should remember to turn the statistics into real children and real families. the work that kinship carers do is incredibly important in delivering stability for those children. we have developed an improvement strategy to identify local authorities at risk of failing and put in place targeted support to help them improve, so that the services families and vulnerable children receive get better faster. we have done that by working in partnership with the association of directors of children ' s services and the lga to test the new regional improvement alliances. we believe that that will complement the new ofsted framework, enabling a new phase of continuous sector - led improvement. in march i announced that more than a£15 million will go to eight new partners in practice, expanding our local authority peer support programme to improve children ' s services. we know that some of our partners in practice are looking at what can be done to address the increased number of children entering care - this addresses the point made by the hon. member for south shields - and are working with them to understand what might work and how it might be used by other local authorities. we are confident that this comprehensive reform programme will lead to better qualified and developed skilled social workers who are able to make difficult decisions, more confident local authorities and social workers that manage cases themselves including associated risks, and a children ' s social care system that learns what works from evidence and applies it in practice. ultimately, that should all lead to the right decisions being made for children and their families. in addition, as i mentioned earlier, my department is working with the ministry of justice, with which we share responsibility for public family law.""]"

today provides a unique opportunity to enshrine protections for all ivory - bearing species, particularly those listed under cites, which are some of those most at risk. this broadening of the definition of ivory is not just because many cites species are at risk of becoming endangered, but to stop the focus on banning just elephant ivory and so pushing poachers towards other forms of ivory, including hippo, narwhal, killer whale, sperm whale and walrus ivory. as the born free foundation has stated : a€œit would be a tragedy if we worked really hard to save elephants and other species were collateral damage in the process... we recognise that the trade is entrepreneurial and will move to wherever there is an opportunity. a€both the international fund for animal welfare and the born free foundation stated in their evidence to members that an extension of the definition of ivory would be welcome, provided that it did not delay the passage of the bill. during the evidence session, will travers of the born free foundation said : a€œfrom 2007 to 2016 - just under a decade - 78, 000 hippos and hippo products were exported by cites parties. hong kong imported 60 tonnes of hippo ivory between 2004 and 2014...""]"

in my view and, i think, all our views, it is even more important to the united kingdom because of the connectivity for the east of england. research from the brilliant essex chamber of commerce, a great champion of strategic infrastructure improvements across essex that has campaigned and worked with the business community, has shown that 56 % of essex businesses that responded to its survey regularly use the a120. only the a12 at 82 % and the m25 at 72 % were used more than the a120. however, the government know, and have heard not just from me but from successive members of parliament from the east of england over the last decade and more, that the a120 is not fit for purpose. it needs investment to unlock future economic growth and jobs. the a120 is also a dangerous road.']"

it is already there. when portsmouth fans travel to the grounds of bristol rovers, peterborough united, wycombe wanderers and countless other sides in the football league, they see stadiums where fully licensed standing sections are operated. yet back at fratton park they have no choice : standing sections are not allowed. that is all because we previously spent more than three seasons in the top two tiers. i must admit that i am puzzled about why the government think standing becomes safer as the quality of football gets worse. if that is true, southampton fans should not be made to sit. why should divisional status - and historical divisional status, at that - have implications for whether clubs can have standing sections at their grounds?"", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr robertson. i shall try to make some comments while ignoring the taunting of the portsmouth fan on the opposition benches to my right - although it is difficult to ignore. if we want to see who is successful in football, we need only note that southampton has survived in the premier league again this year, while pompey languishes somewhere closer to the sunday leagues. all - seater stadiums have been required by law since 1994. there were good reasons for introducing them, but i think that now is the time to consider whether we can have safe standing as well as seating. safe standing has been trialled and is now accepted as being safe. in 2011 the scottish premier league relaxed its requirement for all - seater stadiums and celtic, as has been mentioned, now has a safe standing space for 3, 000 supporters. next season, league one team shrewsbury town will join celtic and have its own safe standing area. the stunning st mary ' s stadium in southampton has a capacity of more than 32, 000. frequently 32, 000 fans attend to watch - unlike at portsmouth, not far down the road. the saints moved from the iconic dell ground in 2000. we used to stand on the terraces until the move to the new stadium. many football fans want to continue to stand, and southampton fans are no exception. fans in the northam stand all too often still stand, although by law they should not. that presents the club with a difficult decision about how to police the situation ; thus far it has not managed to do it. however, the situation proves that safe standing, even in an environment where there is standing between seats, has been safe for some 18 years at southampton football club.""]"

pointing. if there are so many people interested in becoming nurses and such high levels of vacant posts, why are the government not doing more to convert the applicants into nurses? i expect the minister will say, a€œwe have introduced new routes to expand the number of nursing staff. a€ there are nursing degree apprenticeships that few people are taking up, because employers do not have enough cash to release people to study. nursing associates, who were introduced in a supporting role to the registered nurse, should never be a substitute for registered nurses. these efforts have been small and unpredictable. most importantly, they have not addressed the heart of what grows the number of nurses safely and at scale : higher education. this is workforce panicking, not workforce planning. i expect the minister will say, a€œthis government have grown the number of nurses working in hospitals, a€ which is factually true, but distorts the truth that the overall number of nurses has only grown by less than 1 % since 2010. while there are 7 % more nurses in acute settings, there are 6, 500 fewer nurses in the community, 43 % fewer district nurses, a quarter fewer school nurses, nearly 5, 000 fewer mental health nurses and 40 % fewer learning disability nurses.', 'the hon. lady makes a fair point. training needs to be provided to all staff, but absolutely, those who are not exposed to such people are a particular issue. my comments so far have been decidedly non - partisan, and i hope members from across the house are able to support most of what i have suggested. however, before concluding, i must make some observations about the staffing pressures that affect our public services - particularly changes to student nursing bursaries. we have heard in the house many times that the current financial settlement for student nurses is insufficient given the intensity of their courses. i and many others believe that nursing students need bespoke financial support if the government are to meet their commitment to growing the nursing workforce. those students need support for living costs to incentivise a wider range of applications. there are many ways that can be done - through universal grants for students in recognition of their placements, means - tested grants to maintain diversity or targeted support for parents and carers, as many nursing students come to university later in life. since the coalition government came to power in 2010, specialist areas such as learning disability and mental health nursing have been the worst hit by the wider staffing crisis. those specialties struggle to recruit, since mature students are particularly likely to choose them. the royal college of nursing reports that there are 40. 5 % fewer learning disability nurses - 2, 176 fewer full - time equivalent nurses - today than in 2010. despite government claims, the removal of the nhs bursary in england failed to increase the number of nursing students. recent data shows that the number of students accepted on to nursing courses in england has fallen by a further 4 % in the past year, and by 8 % since student funding was removed in 2016. intelligence from rcn regional networks indicates that directors of nursing across england are escalating concerns about course provision.', ""last month my mum celebrated her 95th birthday. like many irish nurses of her age, 75 years ago she travelled to london from ireland to start her career in the very first generation of nhs nurses by qualifying as a state enrolled nurse at warlingham park psychiatric hospital. growing up, i saw at first hand just how vital a dedicated, passionate and happy nurse was for the welfare of the patients. that is why i am incensed when i see the treatment of trainee nurses today. let us be clear. nursing students are exceptional. their courses are complex, their training is tough, and they spend significant amounts of time on clinical placement, working all hours of the day and night. they deserve a tuition and living cost funding model that recognises their extraordinary efforts and the importance of those efforts. england is now the only country in the uk without some form of bursary for the nursing degree. that has crumbled the number of nursing applications and fostered an environment that is utterly unfair to nursing students and completely unsafe for patients. the government promised that reforms would provide up to 10, 000 additional nursing and health professional training places but, since the loss of the bursary, nursing applications in england are down by a third and falling fast. in fact, the 2018 figure was the lowest since nursing courses were first included in the ucas system. nursing must be made an attractive profession for all groups, and restoring the bursary is a fundamental step to achieving that. now is not the time to experiment with funding models for nursing students. one in three nurses is due to retire within the decade. ensuring the long - term recruitment of new nurses must be a government priority. that, of course, is before we take account of the brexit impact : 75 % of nhs trusts have done nothing to prepare for the uk ' s departure from the eu.""]"

i appreciate the frustration of passengers who do not have access to stations in her constituency, but i hope the hon. lady has been reassured that the government remain committed to investment that will improve rail services."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the inclusive transport strategy. i am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce this important debate today on an issue that will affect us all at some point in our lives. as i am sure right hon. and hon. members will know, about one in five people in the uk are disabled. we also have an ageing society, and, as people get older, they are more likely to experience a wide range of conditions such as mobility impairments, memory loss, or visual or hearing impairments. as a society, we are also increasingly recognising that not all disabilities are visible and that mental health conditions and cognitive impairments, as well as hearing loss and memory loss, can have just as profound an impact on people as physical disabilities. regardless of the nature of a person ' s disability, they should have the same access to transport and opportunity to travel as everyone else - access to services that most of us take for granted day in, day out. accessible transport helps to reduce social isolation and loneliness, as well as to create opportunities for disabled people to play a more active role in society. disabled people are more than twice as likely to be unemployed as non - disabled people, and the government have a manifesto commitment to get 1 million more disabled people into work by 2027. disabled people might face many barriers to finding employment, but the ability simply to travel should not be one. against this backdrop, i am proud to have been the minister responsible for publishing the government ' s inclusive transport strategy in july. i thank the department for transport ' s accessibility team for all their hard work ; the sector, which we have worked with ; and the disability groups, including the disabled persons transport advisory committee, that helped and advised us. the inclusive transport strategy followed an earlier consultation on a draft accessibility action plan that received over 1, 000 responses.""]"

up of civil partnership and marriage among same - sex couples. since 2013, when marriage was introduced for same - sex couples, an increasing number of couples have chosen marriage instead of civil partnerships. we do not know, however, whether the current levels of demand will be sustained or whether they will change over time. we currently have only two full years of data for civil partnership formation following the introduction of marriage for same - sex couples. given the scale and significance of the decision, it is proportionate to gather more data so that we can be sure that demand has stabilised. our assessment is that we will have a proportionate amount of evidence by september 2019 to be confident in assessing the ongoing level of demand for civil partnerships among same - sex couples. the second piece of work that we are committing to undertake relates to those already in civil partnerships. we continue to consider whether phasing out civil partnerships for same - sex couples is the best way forward. we want to approach the issue sensitively and delicately because it would be wrong to rush towards a decision without understanding how it would affect same - sex couples who continue to opt for a civil partnership and who do not wish to convert their civil partnership into a marriage. we are therefore committing to undertake research with same - sex couples to understand their motivations for forming and remaining in a civil partnership, and what they may do if the evidence drives us to remove them.', ""i congratulate the hon. member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ) on introducing such an important bill. i am proud that the landmark policy of civil partnerships was introduced by labour. we took a stand long before it was considered fashionable or acceptable. we took a stand to allow lesbian, gay and bisexual people to have their relationships recognised by law and to have benefits equal to those for married couples. that proud moment built on labour ' s history of fighting for the equal rights of lgbtq + people, and the civil partnership act 2004 paved the way for same sex marriage. following the passing of same sex - marriage legislation, it is a complete anomaly and unjustice that civil partnerships are not available to all, an anomaly that the government could have easily rectified and would have received support from both sides of the house to do so. although i was not a member at the time, it is clear that the only reason labour did not push further to extend civil partnerships during the passage of the marriage ( same sex couples ) act 2013 was for fear of losing it altogether. we were met with much hostility when we introduced civil partnerships, but we were on a mission to ensure some level of equality as quickly as possible, and we achieved just that. times have now moved on, but it appears that some attitudes have not. allowing some couples to choose whether to marry or to enter a civil partnership while others cannot is no equality at all. that anomaly is not in the spirit of either the civil partnership act or the marriage ( same sex couples ) act, which are based firmly in parity and not in the semantics that are often used to hide bigotry and prejudice. labour members believe that all people should be equal before the law."", ""i echo the support that has been expressed for the bill, which will ensure the registration of stillbirths before 24 weeks and give coroners the power to investigate stillbirths. i will concentrate on the clauses that address civil partnerships. i stress that i understand the case that hon. members have made today, and i applaud the passion of my hon. friend the member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ) for this topic. although i welcome a report and a review to find more evidence, i think that rolling out civil partnerships to everyone is not the right approach, as i am confident such a review would highlight. it is time to refresh our minds as to why civil partnerships were invented. they were invented because same - sex marriage was not legal. civil partnerships were not intended to be a permanent alternative to marriage. they were created to allow same - sex couples access to rights, responsibilities and protections equivalent to those afforded to married couples. that is no longer the case. i appreciate and empathise with the argument that the current situation is unequal because opposite - sex civil partnerships are not available, but the answer is not necessarily to expand civil partnerships. in fact, i would rather see civil partnerships cease altogether. today everyone in the uk can get married. we finally have equality, which is what people have campaigned for and fought for. expanding civil partnerships to all would serve to add an extra tier, which would confuse and complicate commitment, rather than encouraging it. let us also be clear that there is no legal difference between marriage and civil partnership. the differences are in the names, in the ceremonies and the fact that women are, of course, named on their children ' s civil partnership certificates, but we can address that separately - i passionately believe in naming women on their children ' s marriage certificates.""]"

the issue is simple : it comes down to the integrity of the word of a member of her majesty ' s government, the government chief whip. you will recall, mr speaker, that a former prime minister, margaret thatcher, demanded a rerun of a vote - and got it - from a labour government. the answers in the statements made by the prime minister and the leader of the house on 18 july confirmed that the government chief whip was less than candid with his fellow ministers, including the prime minister, by not declaring that he actively instructed conservative mps to break pairing arrangements. it is clear that the prime minister and the leader of the house have unwittingly misled the house by characterising the government chief whip ' s action as an a€œhonest mistakea€. this is a serious breach of the ministerial code. does the minister for the cabinet office believe that the government chief whip ' s integrity is above reproach?

as i have mentioned, work has begun to set up the independent inquiry into the timetable, implementation and deliverability of future timetable changes. that will be chaired by an independent transport expert, the chair of the current independent regulator, the office of rail and road, professor stephen glaister. in parallel to the inquiry, the department for transport is assessing whether northern met its contractual obligation - a subject which a number of hon. members asked about - in the planning and delivery of this timetable change.', ""first of all, we are clear as a government that the performance in the north and the disruption that was caused to rail passengers following the timetable changes that took place on 20 may were unacceptable. it is clear that we saw a combination of delayed network rail infrastructure works and reduced time to plan a modified timetable, which meant that the new timetable was finalised too late. we know that passengers are currently not getting the service they deserve, although there are more northern rail services now than there were earlier this year ; but much more needs to be done. we are working alongside transport for the north, northern, trans pennine express and network rail on improving services and punctuality. we have asked richard george to review the performance of the region ' s rail network and to make recommendations to improve reliability, and where operators are found to be at fault, we will take action.""]"

we take them away from their environment and put them somewhere separate, where they generally respond much better. if people have committed crimes, they should have that impingement placed on them. the use of that technology should be denied them. i think that the purpose of the bill - i did not serve on the public bill committee, so i stand to be corrected on this - is to strengthen safety and security in prisons, through the authorisation of interference of public communications. in 2016 the government published plans for reforming the prison system, including the measures in the bill. the a€œprison safety and reforma€ white paper set out the government ' s plans to deliver a mix of operational changes and to underpin the legal changes required. our prisons face significant security challenges. in 2016, approximately 13, 000 mobile phones and 7, 000 sim cards were found in prisons - an incredible number. that was an increase of 7, 000 mobile phones from 2013."", 'the hon. lady is quite right, and i will go on to explain how mobile phones are used to continue crime in our prison service. to reiterate, last year 23, 656 mobile phones were found in our prisons, which is nearly 65 a day. in my constituency, 184 mobile phones and 80 sim cards were found at hmp lewes last year, and having visited the prison regularly and met prison officers and the governor, i have heard at first hand the implications of that. as the hon. lady pointed out, illegal mobile phones present a serious risk to the security of our prisons, as well as to public safety. mobile phones in prisons are used for a range of criminal purposes, including commissioning serious violence, harassing victims, and continuing involvement in extremist activity and organised crime. access to mobile phones is strongly associated with drug supplies and violence in our prisons, so it is a serious problem. it might be argued that the prison service should be better at stopping mobiles entering our prisons in the first place, but as the previous justice secretary made clear in a speech to reform in december last year, technological advances have been harnessed by some manufacturers with the clear intention of circumventing prison security measures. technological advances have made it possible to manufacture phones so small, and containing so little metal, that they can be concealed internally and are difficult to detect with existing screening machines. phones have been marketed as a€œbeat the bossa€, which refers to the body orifice security scanner that is in use in our prison receptions. however, just as technology can be harnessed for illicit ends, we can also enlist its support to improve the effectiveness of our response to the problem. public communications providers such as mobile phone operators have been at the forefront of rapid technological developments in mobile communications.', ""this welcome bill goes some way to addressing the issues surrounding mobile phones in prison, and as my hon. friend the member for west ham ( lyn brown ) said, evidence has shown time and again that mobile phones have been smuggled into prison for use by inmates, often to enable them to engage in further illegal activity. they are used illicitly to order drugs, harass victims, and organise crime, both inside and outside the prison. the use of phones for such activities is completely unacceptable, but figures indicate that the number of phones conveyed into prisons for use by inmates is increasing. the hon. member for lewes ( maria caulfield ) gave some figures, and i shall present some others that show a similar trend. in 2013, there were around 7, 500 reported incidences of mobile phones and sim cards being found in prison, but by 2015 that figure had increased to nearly 17, 000. mobile phone use in prisons is a problem that needs tackling, and the bill is a welcome step forward. i might question whether back benchers should be driving forward legislation to tackle illegal prison activity, rather than the government, but nevertheless the ability to interfere with wireless telegraphy and to disrupt mobile phone use in a designated, specified area could have a significant impact in reducing the use of mobile phones and, subsequently, any further illegal activity through their use. although the bill goes some way to addressing organised violence and drugs in prisons, it cannot be seen as a panacea to end the problems in our prisons. violence, drugs, and further crime are not helped by the government ' s treatment of our prisons system, which has produced an environment that allows them to flourish. the government ' s decision to slash prison budgets, axe prison officers and neglect our prisons has led to overcrowding and violence.""]"

building of the andsf.', ""with permission, mr speaker, i will make a statement on afghanistan. the united kingdom will never forget the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks and the thousands of innocent women, men and children killed in the atrocity. that barbaric violence prompted the uk, alongside our nato allies, to enter afghanistan to ensure that terrorists could not use it as a base from which to attack our citizens at home or abroad. before i continue, i want to pay tribute to the efforts of the tens of thousands of brave british men and women who have served in afghanistan for the past 16 years. we will never forget what they did, particularly those 456 brave men and women who paid the ultimate price and those who suffered life - changing injuries in the line of duty. their service and sacrifice has not been in vain. as i saw when i visited back in march, not only do millions of ordinary afghans now have access to clean water, vital medicine and education, which would not have seemed possible less than 20 years ago, not only have they enabled the afghan people to take charge of their own security, and not only is the capability of the afghan national defence and security forces growing, but elections are giving a voice to the people of afghanistan, who are increasingly calling for peace, which would have been unthinkable a short time ago. our commitment to afghanistan remains an enduring one. although uk combat operations ended in 2014, our troops are playing a key role in nato ' s resolute support mission by leading the kabul security force. they are performing a vital role in training, advising and assisting the afghan national army and air force and developing the nationwide security structures that will strengthen afghanistan ' s democracy. they have a quick reaction force that works alongside the afghan army to provide urgent help in kabul if and when required."", 'the hon. lady raises a very serious issue. the terrorist attack that she refers to was indeed appalling. as she said, too many victims lost their lives as a result of that attack that took place in afghanistan. it is important that we ensure that we are providing support, as we do through our contribution in afghanistan. that is a contribution to security in the kabul area specifically from our forces, but it is also about working with others to ensure that the afghan security forces are able to provide security and safety for all communities living in afghanistan. tremendous achievements have been made in afghanistan today, compared with the situation before these efforts, but sadly, as the hon. lady highlights, too many terrorist attacks are still taking place in afghanistan. we will continue to work with our allies and the afghan government to prevent these in future and to ensure that people can go about their daily lives in safety and security and with confidence.']"

it makes no sense. it is not just. 50 calibre rifles either ; it is exactly the same for. 357 lapua magnum rifles. it does not matter if someone home loads, as my hon. friend the member for strangford ( jim shannon ) said, and lowers the velocity of the round, because the bill is framed so that what matters is not what they put through a firearm but what the firearm is capable of delivering. i am afraid that the public safety test in the bill does not cut it. a. 22 rifle can remove life and has a much lower velocity. families often introduce their young ones to the sport of firearms shooting - target shooting, plinking around the farm - with. 22 rifles or air rifles, but a person can still lose their life from a. 22. what, then, are we trying to achieve? what arguments and evidence base has the home office used to advance these provisions? i do not think they have any, and neither do sporting enthusiasts throughout the country. there has never been any discernible or detected use of rifles of this calibre, legally held, in the commission of a crime. some mention was made of the northern ireland provisions that allow us to access handguns and other firearms that people cannot access in the rest of the uk. that is true. several members of this house are in that position.']"

the appointment of the first victims ' commissioner to champion the interests of victims and witnesses in 2010 ; and the publication of a€œgetting it right for victims and witnessesa€ in 2012, which set out the government ' s approach to ensuring that victims and witnesses get the support they need. the victims strategy consolidates and builds on that progress but recognises that more still needs to be done. i thank and pay tribute to all the victims, victims ' groups and experts who have willingly shared their experiences and sat on the victims panel, and to my predecessor, my hon. friend the member for bracknell ( dr lee ), who initiated this work."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mrs main. it has been a pleasure to hear all the contributions this afternoon, especially that of my hon. friend the member for telford ( lucy allan ). i hope i can go some way to answer all the questions, including the battery of questions that the shadow minister just posed. if i do not answer the questions appropriately, hon. members will get correspondence following the debate. i thank the hon. member for leeds north west ( alex sobel ) for securing this debate on the rights of victims of crime. it is particularly timely given the recent focus on such matters in a number of high - profile cases. i know through my own personal experience of meeting victims of crime, speaking with support organisations and meeting many of the hon. members present, exactly how important such rights are in the lives of victims. i am therefore grateful for the opportunity to discuss them with you today. victims ' rights are now a fundamental part of our justice system, and ensuring that victims receive the rights they are entitled to is a priority for this government. that is essential if we are to enable victims to cope with and recover from crime. we must also continue to drive improvement in the broader experience of victims, which involves ensuring that criminal justice agencies provide victims with a service appropriate to their needs and respectful of them as individuals. that also requires focus on the wider performance of agencies. victims want cases to be well managed and dealt with swiftly. beyond the criminal justice agencies, it is important that victim support services are in a position to offer victims the sorts of support they may need to aid their long - term recovery. turning to the current framework of victims ' rights, we look first to the statutory victims code, which does two fundamentally important things. first, it sets out for victims exactly what they are entitled to receive from the criminal justice system.""]"

there is a shortage of such people. we are also very much aware that if hospices are to compete for staff and to recruit and - crucially - retain staff, they must be able to make this pay award, which is extremely welcome. that is the essence of this debate. hon. members made some really important points about the wider issues of funding, which are important, and about the lack of funding. i am grateful to the hon. member for st ives ( derek thomas ) for sharing a very personal family experience from his local hospice and for making the important point that hospices allow people to live and die well, which is absolutely crucial. it is important to set this debate, which is essentially about funding, in a wider context, looking in the first instance at the vast array of services provided by hospices. the majority of hospices are charitable organisations, and provide absolutely tremendous support to the nhs but are not directly part of it. there are in the region of 3, 000 in - patient hospice beds in the uk, where patients are helped to manage pain and other symptoms.', ""i thank the hon. member for liverpool, walton ( dan carden ) for the way in which he has approached this debate. i commend him on making an excellent speech, as he could not have been better at articulating the positive contribution that hospices make. i do not think there was anything in his speech with which i disagreed, which is quite unusual. i was struck by the hon. gentleman ' s description of hospices as places where people go to live. when i visit hospices, i am struck by the very real efforts that their staff go to to make them comforting places. it can be a more difficult time for the loved ones than it is for the person who is ending their life, but they really are comforting places, and the hon. gentleman is right to pay tribute to all the staff who work in them. the hon. gentleman powerfully praised the efforts of his own hospice, woodlands, which is clearly providing an excellent service. i am grateful that he has given me the opportunity to address some of the concerns and make it clear how much we value the contribution that hospices make to the nhs. it is testament to the excellence of our hospice sector that last october ' s a€œstate of carea€ report by the care quality commission showed that 70 % of hospices are rated as good and 25 % as outstanding. those figures are higher than for any other secondary care service, which illustrates the significance of hospices ' contribution. woodlands hospice received a good rating in the cqc report. like the hon. gentleman, i congratulate its hard - working staff and volunteers on ensuring that patients get the personalised care and support that they need. nhs england has advised that liverpool clinical commissioning group, which is the main commissioner for the hospice - i hear what the hon.""]"

they called it an experiment and accused us of creating a divide in the state school system. eight years on, we see that they were wrong. the first free schools and new academies opened in 2011 and our schools are performing better than ever. whereas only 68 % of state - funded schools were good or outstanding in 2010, that jumped to 89 % at the end of august 2017. nowhere is more exemplary of the benefits that free schools and academies bring to the system than the two boroughs in my constituency - the royal borough of kensington and chelsea, and hammersmith and fulham. indeed, k and c and h and f - under the conservatives until 2014 - have been the vibrant nucleus of schools reform since 2010. in those two boroughs, which are the smallest in london, an astonishing five new secondary schools have opened since 2010, and every one of them is a free school or academy. kensington aldridge academy, chelsea academy, hammersmith academy, fulham boys school and west london free school are providing places for more than 3, 700 students. i attended three of the openings - two of them with the secretary of state at the time.', 'those schools have not closed ; they have been re - brokered very successfully to others. the essence of the free schools and academies programme is that we do not allow schools to languish in special measures year after year, which in essence is what was happening when those schools were under local authority control. we take very swift action where schools underperform, and we will not change the law that requires schools to become academies once they go into special measures, because that is how we get improvement. i will come on to some of the examples of how that works in due course. every child in this country, regardless of where they live or their background, should have the opportunity to benefit from the very best education. free schools and academies have shown that professional autonomy in the hands of able headteachers and teachers can deliver a world - class education. for example, dixons trinity academy, a free school in bradford, achieved extraordinary results in 2017. its first set of gcses placed it among the top schools in england for the progress achieved by its pupils. strikingly, the progress score for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds was higher than that for the whole school, including more affluent peers. that school and many others show that socioeconomic background should not and need not be a barrier to academic success. leading multi - academy trusts, often led by inspirational headteachers, demonstrate that excellence need not be restricted to isolated schools. thanks to a forensic approach to curriculum design and the implementation of evidence - based approaches to managing behaviour, the inspiration trust in norfolk and the harris federation in london - two of the best performing multi - academy trusts - have conclusively demonstrated that all pupils can achieve whether they live in coastal norfolk or inner - city london.', ""as i have said, in 2016, cambridgeshire county council issued the school with a warning notice. to ensure sustainability of standards the interim executive board was established. the board is consulting on the next steps, and it has made the decision that it is best for the school to become an academy under the diocese. it is consulting on that decision, and it is taking parents ' views into account. it had a meeting today, as the hon. gentleman said, and it will continue to go through the process. overall in cambridgeshire, 97 % of secondary schools are academies or free schools, and we expect that to be 100 % shortly. one third of primary schools are currently academies or free schools, and that number is expected to rise in the coming year, with 17 schools currently moving to academy status. in the hon. gentleman ' s constituency, there are six secondary schools. five of them are academies, and the remaining school intends to become an academy this term. there are 23 primary schools and a maintained special school. just two of the primary schools are academies or free schools, and four primary schools are currently going through the process of joining a multi - academy trust, which is significantly lower than elsewhere in cambridgeshire. in september 2014, 82 % of primary schools in cambridge were rated good or outstanding by ofsted. in november last year, that rose to 91 %, which is above the national average. four of the five secondary academies have positive progress 8 scores, including chesterton community college, part of cambridgeshire educational trust, which is in the top 1 % of schools nationally and was recently graded by ofsted as outstanding. cambridgeshire educational trust is a great example of the development of the school - led system in which teaching approaches have raised academic results.""]"

the latest figures show that services for deaf children are reducing across england. that means that their futures are being a€œstolena€, as the national deaf children ' s society puts it, because without the support, intervention and specialist skills that they need, they will not be able to make the best educational and social progress compared with other children who are not deaf or hearing impaired. that cannot be right. there are more than 50, 000 deaf children and young people in the uk. as we have heard, more than 90 % of them are born to hearing parents who have no prior experience of deafness. some 80 % of those children attend mainstream schools, where they may be the only deaf child in their school. figures from the national deaf children ' s society show a stark difference in educational achievement as it is. in the early years foundation stage, 34 % of pre - school deaf children were reported as having a good level of development compared with 76 % of other children. at key stage 2, less than half of deaf children achieved the expected standard for reading, compared with 80 % of other children. at key stage 4, deaf children achieve, on average, a whole grade less in each gcse subject than other children. in recent years this attainment gap has widened."", ""i agree strongly with my hon. friend ' s point. it is really important that deaf children are able to take part fully in the life of the school. in 2016 - 17, signature carried out a survey of more than 2, 000 young people, of whom 700 were deaf and 1, 400 were hearing, on behalf of the national deaf children ' s society youth advisory board, which is made up of young people from across the uk, such as erin, who believe strongly that there should be more opportunities for young people - deaf or hearing - to learn bsl, which is an officially recognised language in the uk. the survey showed that 91 % of young people want to learn sign language, 92 % think schools should offer a bsl gcse, and 97 % think bsl should be taught in schools. their reasons include inclusivity, as doing those things would ensure that deaf people are fully integrated into society and not disadvantaged because others cannot communicate with them effectively ; the importance of communication in general ; and equality - they likened learning bsl to learning french or spanish and said that bsl was at least equally important. they thought that being able to use bsl would improve employment prospects, both directly and indirectly, but many did not know of anywhere they could learn it at no or little cost. i have already mentioned the shortage of qualified teachers of the deaf, but there is a wider shortage. in 2017, the department for work and pensions highlighted that shortages in sign language interpreters have resulted in higher costs for government programmes such as access to work, and have made it harder for deaf people to enter the workplace. a gcse could lead to more people considering interpreting for deaf people as a career. i do not want to make this petition downbeat."", ""i thank my hon. friend for that intervention. i agree with that statement, and i hope to explain why. the petitioners want bsl to be part of the national curriculum, giving better life chances to young people who are deaf. they believe that if bsl becomes part of the national curriculum, that will even up the chances of deaf young people being able to play a full part in school and attain the best results they can. let us look at the case. research by the national deaf children ' s society into the attainment of deaf children in 2017 shows that deaf children continue to underachieve throughout their education compared with other children. although the department for education claimed recently that attainment for deaf children is at an all - time high, the latest figures show that the attainment gap between deaf children and children with no identified special needs is widening, with the gap at gcse level being particularly worrying. in 2016, 41. 3 % of deaf children achieved the expected benchmark of five gcses at a * to c grade, compared with 69. 3 % of children with no identified special needs. that is a difference of more than 20 %, which is just not acceptable in this day and age. all that is in the context of a reduction of 14 % in the number of qualified teachers of the deaf since 2011, and a 2 % reduction in just one year - 2016 - 17. we know that we have to do more to help deaf pupils to achieve their full potential and that we need to reverse the reduction in the number of teachers of the deaf. we can do that partly by ensuring that young deaf pupils are able to have effective communication. for many, that will be through bsl. bsl has been a recognised language since 2003, but unlike other languages it is not recognised as a gcse that can be taught in schools.""]"

what about the huge number of existing meters that will be removed and need to be disposed of as smart meters are installed? those meters are not owned by installers but by meter asset providers that finance and ultimately own the meters that are put in. it has been a long - standing arrangement in the industry that meters are not owned by the suppliers but merely read by the suppliers. that means that when a programme is pursued of removing old meters, whether dumb meters or previous generation smart meters, there is a problem in identifying whose meters they are. the difficulty that we are facing right now - it is not a problem for the future - is that we might see meter mountains arising in this country because the people who are removing the meters do not know who their owners are or who is going to take them away and recycle and dispose of them. i do not want to see, as a result of this roll - out programme, meter mountains, or alps, appearing across the country.']"

teenage mothers are nearly four times as likely to smoke before or during pregnancy than those aged 35 and over. young mothers are less likely to quit before or during pregnancy, and only 38 % of mothers under the age of 20 did so, compared with 58 % of mothers aged 35 or above. it is clear that the government need to tackle smoking in pregnancy, and smoking in childhood, as a matter of urgency to achieve their ambition of a smoke - free generation. the minister and his department have a huge challenge on their hands if they are to meet the ambitious targets set out in the tobacco control plan. i still welcome the plan as the right thing to do, as i am sure the minister does. anything that is worth doing is going to be hard. we have four years to go before the target date, and the minister must now look at how the government can properly fund smoking cessation services to drive down smoking rates and support those who need extra help to stop smoking. i look forward to the remainder of the debate and the minister ' s closing remarks."", ""it is a pleasure to take part in today ' s debate, and i welcome the one - year anniversary of the tobacco control policy for england. a great deal of progress has been made in reducing smoking prevalence across the uk. as has been pointed out, whereas in 1974 more than half of adult males and more than two in five women smoked, the latest figures from nhs digital suggest that smoking rates in the uk are now 15. 1 %. so i say congratulations on that achievement. the figures on smoking prevalence in scotland, where i come from, vary as between sources, but the office for national statistics has suggested a prevalence rate of 16. 3 % in 2017. since 2010, scotland has seen the largest decline in the proportion of smokers of the four uk jurisdictions, with a reduction of more than eight percentage points. that said, there are still about 10, 000 smoking - related deaths per year and 128, 000 smoking - related hospital admissions in scotland. the scottish government published their new five - year tobacco control plan in june. it goes a little further than the tobacco control plan for england, in that it not only puts forward a vision of a smoke - free generation but sets a date, 2034, by which we wish to achieve that vision. if scotland is to achieve its vision, it requires action by the westminster government on issues that are not devolved, such as tax, illicit trade and smoking in the entertainment media. page 14 of the tobacco control plan for scotland commits the scottish government toa€œcontinue to work with the uk government to address the representation of tobacco use in the media. a€that is not something that the scottish government can do on their own. a clear causal link has been established between exposure to smoking on screen in the entertainment media and smoking initiation in young people."", ""i beg to move, that leave be given to bring in a bill to require the secretary of state to report on means of requiring tobacco companies to meet the costs of smoking cessation services ; to make provision about the advertising and marketing of products that are alternatives to tobacco ; to require tobacco companies to publish information about their activities in relation to such products ; to create an offence of selling tobacco without a licence ; and for connected purposes. in 1990, almost one third of adults in great britain smoked. the most recent figures show that this has almost halved - the prevalence rate is now 15. 8 %. the government ' s ambition, set out in the tobacco control plan last year, is to reach 12 % or less by 2022, with a longer - term aim of achieving a 5 % prevalence rate. despite that relative success, the uk still has 7. 6 million smokers, which means that more than 200 people a day still die from smoking - related illnesses that could have been prevented, and that smoking is estimated to cost our economy in excess of a£11 billion a year. in 2017, local authorities cut their budgets for stop smoking services in half. separately, the number of smokers using nhs stop smoking services has decreased from a peak of 100, 000 in 2011 to 40, 000 in 2016. the bill aims to highlight what a package of measures could do to accelerate the decline in smoking prevalence. at the heart of this new approach is the creation of a new fund that would be used primarily to supplement local authorities ' cessation expenditure, while simultaneously encouraging cigarette companies to shift away from combustible products to less harmful alternatives. i know many are very wary of those products and the fact that many are produced or funded by tobacco companies. we must recognise that the tobacco companies have been extremely dishonest in the past about the harm caused by smoking.""]"

it covers door - to - door transport, ranging from the relatively informal lift giving by volunteer car drivers to more organised schemes such as a dial - a - ride or dial - a - bus for people with disabilities and mobility difficulties. it involves community bus services and covers minibus travel for groups of people such as the elderly or others who struggle to get out and about on their own, where they are taken on shopping trips and such like."", 'that is a really important point ; i thank the hon. gentleman for that intervention. the problem is that, as a consequence of the regulations, people will be denied access to local amenities, leisure facilities and employment opportunities. my hon. friend the member for nottingham south indicated the cost - some a£400 million. people are rightly angry and frustrated about the implications of the changes. i am angry about the quality of the transport infrastructure in my constituency, and this will simply compound that. the proposed guidance from the government implies that community transport providers need to show that they are not blocking commercial operators that may wish to deliver a local service on a particular route - the section 19 and 22 recommendations that have been mentioned. however, community transport is plugging the gaps of a failing commercial network. the ongoing withdrawal of commercial bus services means that the community transport sector as a whole has gained growing importance in filling transport gaps, particularly in largely rural areas such as mine. many voluntary transport services are financially fragile, and rely on donations and the goodwill of volunteers to continue. the government must realise that community transport is about so much more than simply moving people from a to b. it brings people together, teaches people new skills, makes disabled and elderly people in rural areas less socially isolated, improves physical and mental health, and makes communities pull together to tackle many issues that they face on a daily basis. i share the reservations of community transport providers in my constituency that the department for transport, sitting in splendid isolation in offices in central london, may find it difficult to comprehend the service and support provided by community transport. i share the view of my hon. friend the member for nottingham south that the narrow and legalistic approach that the government are adopting to community transport is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.', ""i, like a number of colleagues, will focus on community transport. as a labour and co - operative mp, i am particularly keen to talk about the not - for - profit sector. the co - operative party believes that community transport and commercial bus routes should be designated community assets that are, as my hon. friend the member for harrow west ( gareth thomas ) said, subject to the same protections as community assets are afforded under the localism act 2011. tens of thousands of people rely on these services for some of the most socially necessary journeys. the government ' s announcement that they seek to change regulations on the community transport sector was a big surprise. as a result, many such services are now under threat, and there will be a reduction in this socially necessary public transport. community transport is a very broad term. it includes local road passenger transport services delivered by charities and other not - for - profit organisations, typically where there is no viable commercial market. the core of community transport organisations includes door - to - door transport, informal lift - giving by volunteer car drivers, dial - a - ride and dial - a - bus, particularly for people with disabilities and mobility difficulties, and groups such as the elderly and others who struggle to get out and about. this transport is required, for example, to take them on shopping trips. the community transport association estimates that tens of thousands of people, many of whom are the most vulnerable in our communities, access this form of transport. it has outlined why these journeys are such a lifeline for many. preston community transport, which is based in my constituency, is just one such community transport organisation. it claims that there are nowa€œsignificant problems as a result of the department for transport ' s proposed changes to permits and licences.""]"

winning scientist, the word a€œmuslima€ has been erased from his gravestone, under a court order. electoral disenfranchisement, discrimination in law and expulsion by society have left the ahmadi community in pakistan voiceless. so today we must be their voice, for even the constraints of life provide no constraints for the persecution that an ahmadi in pakistan may face. such persecution, however, is found not just in pakistan, algeria, egypt, burundi and indonesia - it can be found right here in the uk, right on our doorstep. over recent weeks, the all - party parliamentary group on the ahmadiyya muslim community, which i proudly chair, has been running a five - part inquiry into the persecution faced by the ahmadi community. we have heard the testimony of dozens of ahmadi men and women, describing the scale of hatred that they have faced. it is truly shocking. the most stark and shocking example in the uk took place just two years ago in glasgow, where ahmadi shopkeeper asad shah was brutally murdered."", ""i absolutely agree with my hon. friend. in indonesia, ahmadiyya is not an authorised religion. so when an ahmadi tries to secure identity documents requiring an authorised religion to be shown, they simply cannot get them. furthermore, ahmadi mosques have been burned down, ahmadis have been denied their voting rights, and they have been driven out of their homes, as my hon. friend said. i am afraid to say that in indonesia the persecution comes from the very top. in 2008 a joint ministerial decree introduced by the minister of religious affairs, the attorney general and the minister of home affairs prohibited the promulgation of ahmadiyya teachings. the minister of religious affairs followed this up with calls for an outright ban against the ahmadis in 2011. but perhaps the persecution is best illustrated by the calls from the governor of west java, who claimed there would be no violence against the ahmadiyya community if there were no ahmadi teachings or practices. the a€œproblema€, he suggests, a€œwill disappear if the belief disappears. a€it is no wonder therefore that just last weekend 23 ahmadis sought refuge at east lombok police station, escaping after an angry mob destroyed their homes in an attempt to expel them from the area. away from indonesia, there are currently 10, 000 ahmadi refugees stuck in limbo in countries including sri lanka, malaysia and thailand, all having fled persecution in their home countries. sri lanka even tried to deport 88 ahmadis back to pakistan in 2014 despite claims that they could be at risk in their homeland, and so it is to pakistan that i now turn. for it is in pakistan that the world ' s largest ahmadi community exists, with an estimated 4 million members, and it is there that the persecution ahmadis face can perhaps be most prominently found."", 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr walker. it is also a pleasure to follow the hon. member for torbay ( kevin foster ). i thank the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) for securing this incredibly important debate and for his tireless campaign for all those around the world who are persecuted because of their faith. as the proud chair of the all - party parliamentary group for the ahmadiyya muslim community, my contribution will focus largely on the persecution of the ahmadis. one of the largest mosques in western europe is on the border of my constituency. as several hon. members have said, the community identifies as muslim but does not believe that mohammed was the final prophet sent to guide mankind. that belief has led to widespread persecution across the world, and, i am afraid to say, even in the uk, as has been mentioned. i will take hon. members on a global tour, from indonesia to islamabad, bangkok to burundi, and describe the day - to - day reality faced by the community. in algeria, 280 ahmadi muslims have been arrested on the grounds of their faith in the last two years alone. in burundi, 13 young ahmadis were arrested earlier this year while attending a religious education class. in egypt, the interior minister started the year by issuing arrest warrants for at least 25 ahmadis, including the publications secretary for the ahmadiyya muslim community. in kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan, ahmadis are the only international religious group denied the right to register as a religious community. in indonesia, ahmadiyya muslim is not even an authorised religion. in pakistan, as we have heard, it is a criminal offence for ahmadis to call themselves muslim, name their place of worship a mosque or even say the islamic greeting. hundreds of ahmadis have been murdered in pakistan.']"

only trade has received nearly 93, 000 signatures. this issue has been the subject of a long - standing campaign by animal welfare organisations, but as most people who have followed the issue know, and as my hon. friend acknowledged, european union free trade rules have prevented the government from taking meaningful action on this over the past 30 years. however, once we leave the european union, we will be able to take action on what for many people is an iconic animal welfare issue. while eu trade rules might have prevented governments from banning the live export trade, we have still seen a dramatic change in the numbers of live animals exported, particularly those destined for slaughter. some 25 years ago, around 2 million animals were exported each and every year. the peak of live exports going from the uk for slaughter was in 1992, when a total of around 400, 000 cattle, 300, 000 pigs and nearly 1. 5 million sheep were exported from the uk directly for slaughter. as a result of the high number of animals being exported, live export became extremely controversial, with widespread demonstrations against it at the main ports during the 1990s. port authorities and shipping companies were put under considerable pressure to end the trade, which led to nearly all the main ferry operators refusing to take animals destined for slaughter.', 'i congratulate my hon. friend the member for st austell and newquay ( steve double ) on introducing the debate. i want to touch on a number of issues very briefly, and to deal with a couple of the points raised by my hon. friend the member for north herefordshire ( bill wiggin ). i normally agree with him, but on this occasion there is clearly a little difference between us. let us tackle the fundamental difference between live animals for slaughter, live animals for fattening and live animals for breeding stock. we all understand what a€œlive animals for slaughtera€ means - that is what the petition is about. my understanding is that a€œlive animals for fatteninga€ is a euphemism for exporting livestock from the united kingdom to france, spain, italy or greece, where they spend a couple of days in a field and are then slaughtered and branded as local meat, be that french, spanish, greek or italian. effectively, those animals are live animals for slaughter. my view is that any control exercise should embrace those animals, as well as those that are openly and honestly - if that is the right word - exported for slaughter. breeding stock is different. rather like the racehorses that were referred to earlier, they are high - value animals, they are well looked after and they are transported with great care. that is not the case with animals that are exported for other purposes. the standards in the united kingdom may occasionally be not too bad, but the standards in mainland europe are unenforced and unenforceable. in theory they are supposed to be high, but in practice, as we all know, they are not.', 'i am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, mr wilson, and to take part in a debate on such an important issue. the export of live farm animals can cause great suffering in many cases, as was outlined by a number of right hon. and hon. members, particularly my hon. friends the members for st austell and newquay ( steve double ) and for southend west ( sir david amess ), and the hon. member for bristol east ( kerry mccarthy ). last year i proposed a ten - minute rule bill to implement a ban on the export of live animals for slaughter or for fattening, because i believe it to be unethical to export animals to countries where they can be subjected to treatment that would be unlawful in the united kingdom. i am concerned, as are many others who have spoken this afternoon, that the rules regulating the transport and slaughter of animals that are supposed to apply across every eu member state are not always effectively enforced in every part of the european union once animals leave this country. many of the sheep exported from the uk are sent to france, but there is clear evidence of inhumane and illegal slaughter practices in a number of places there - a problem acknowledged in a 2016 report by a committee of inquiry in the french parliament. in my view, that of the people who signed the petition, and that of many of my constituents, it is not acceptable for the uk to send animals to die in such horrendous conditions. we have had extensive discussion about calves that are exported from scotland to spain, and are subjected to a 20 - hour sea journey to northern france, and then a drive all the way to spain. the total journey time can be as much as 135 hours.']"

working staff who have gone for years without a decent pay rise. while some hospitals offer free or discounted parking for specific kinds of treatment or for people in receipt of specific benefits, there are significant variations in fees across trusts in the same region. wexham park hospital in my constituency has some of the highest parking charges in the region : a£3. 30 after the first 15 minutes and an increase, in stages, to a£8 over five hours. that is the situation in my constituency, but that trust is only doing what all other trusts are no doubt doing and it is within government guidelines. i do not want older and vulnerable patients to be deterred from attending hospital. they should be able to get to their appointments in a comfortable, dignified, affordable manner and within a reasonable time. most nhs car parking charges have been abolished in scotland and wales, and i know that the government have issued guidance to nhs trusts on the implementation of car parking charges, including the provision of discounted or free parking. these guidelines are not based in legislation and appear to have had little effect. the labour government in 2010 left fully costed plans to phase out charges for in - patients and their visitors, and in 2015 a private member ' s bill on this subject gained cross - party support but was talked out. clearly, many across the country and the house want an end to hospital car parking charges. let us send a clear message today that there is another way forward and that this unfair stealth tax on the vulnerable must end."", ""i am so glad that the right hon. gentleman raised that issue, because the concession that i was talking about is available only to the patient, not to the low -

pressed nhs staff. car parking charges are a tax on serious illness. labour would scrap car parking charges at all hospitals. we would fund that by raising insurance tax on private healthcare to 20 %, to meet the a£162 million cost of providing free parking at all nhs hospitals in england. charities, trade unions, the british medical association, the society for acute medicine and the public are all calling out for the government to listen. in scotland and wales, car parking charges have been abolished in all but a handful of hospitals. we should show some humanity and do the same. i support the motion."", ""it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for telford ( lucy allan ). we all know that our nhs is underfunded. the hospital trust in my constituency, the hull and east yorkshire hospitals nhs trust, received more than a£1. 5 million in car parking charges in 2016 - 17, according to data released under a freedom of information request, so it might seem unusual for me to be calling for the abolition of car parking charges. we know that they can provide an income for hospitals, but i agree with the hon. lady : much of the money does not go to the hospital, but often to the private operator of the car park. it is the government ' s responsibility to ensure that our nhs has the money it needs and not that of patients, staff or visitors. we should not expect vulnerable people to pay a sickness tax through car parking charges. i also agree with my hon. friend the member for great grimsby ( melanie onn ) about the impact on residents living in the local area. in walker street opposite my hospital, resident permits have had to be introduced to try to stop other people parking on those streets. in effect, the residents who live there have to pay to park their cars, because staff cannot afford to use the car park and park their cars on those streets. the whole system is complete nonsense. i am incredibly proud that our labour manifesto pledged to scrap car parking charges. our suggestion was that any loss in income could come from a hike in the tax on private healthcare insurance. that would meet the a£162 million cost of free parking at all nhs hospitals across england. the unfairness of the sickness tax, from having car parking charges, must be felt in context. let me tell the chamber about a dear friend of mine -

what my right hon. friend would call, quite rightly, an a€œexemplara€. yesterday ' s conclusion of the negotiations between the brexit secretary and michel barnier, with the transition period, showed that exactly the sort of thinking that we need for the automotive industry is recognised by our own government and by the european union. i am confident that that is largely the result of successful government lobbying by the automotive industry - in which, of course, vauxhall has taken part."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the future of the vauxhall factory in ellesmere port. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr rosindell. when i am at home in my constituency, i get up to go to work and i head off in my astra, of course. i go past many houses where vauxhall employees and pensioners live, and many houses where the family and friends of people who work at vauxhall live - and that is before i get to the end of my street. at the end of the street, i drive past a newsagent that relies on trade from vauxhall employees, like many other local businesses. as hon. members will understand from what i am saying, ellesmere port is synonymous with vauxhall motors. the first vauxhall viva rolled off the production line in 1964. as the plant grew, so did the town. there is virtually nobody who lives in ellesmere port who does not have some connection with the plant. at its height, it employed around 12, 000 people. sadly, with recent job losses, the number is about a tenth of that today, but it is still substantial. we also have to take into account the fact that for every person employed at the plant, three other people are employed in the local economy. there is also the potential for greater numbers should we increase from single - shift production again in the future. vauxhall remains a big part of the local economy. we should build our future success on such jobs : highly skilled, permanent jobs that manufacture something of national and local pride. vauxhall ' s advertising material makes much of the significance of its being a uk manufacturer, but this is about more than being a uk manufacturer, or a key part of the local economy.""]"

it is abundantly clear to me that we are doing the right thing today. it is a pleasure to follow the shadow minister, and i congratulate my hon. friend the member for thirsk and malton ( kevin hollinrake ) on introducing this important bill and getting it to this stage. i also congratulate my hon. friend the member for colchester ( will quince ), who originally introduced this bill in the last parliament. he has been a big voice in this place for bereaved parents. losing a child is the most traumatic thing that can happen to a parent, and it is right that we introduce safeguards for bereaved parents going through such a painful and unimaginable experience. parental bereavement has been brought into sharp focus since the start of the 2015 parliament, notably by my hon. friends the members for colchester and for eddisbury ( antoinette sandbach ), who have both shared their experiences in a number of debates. i remember when my hon. friend the member for colchester led an adjournment debate on maternity units and bereavement care in november 2015. the accounts that he and my hon. friend the member for eddisbury gave then significantly raised the profile of parental bereavement. since then, my hon. friends and many others have taken part in debates and continued to campaign in support of bereaved parents. i have no doubt that that campaign led to the conservative manifesto commitment to ensure that all families who lose a child are entitled to bereavement leave and pay. there has clearly been a lack of support for bereaved parents. i have no doubt that the campaigning on the issue by members from all parties - including, notably, my hon.', 'my hon. friend is absolutely right, and i thank him for the support he has given to the appg since its formation. he is right that just one stillbirth or neonatal death is one too many, and while we should rightly campaign for reductions - we have ambitious targets in that regard - it is absolutely right to ensure that even if we hit those targets, as i will come to later, we make sure we have world - class bereavement care for those parents and families who sadly suffer the loss of a child. through the pathway, we can work to ensure that they receive the best - quality bereavement care that the nhs can deliver. bereavement care has been a priority for the appg for two reasons. first, there is sadly an inconsistency in the quality and standard of bereavement care across the country. every parent and family who suffer the loss of a child should receive the same high - quality bereavement care no matter where they live, yet that is not the case at the moment. a report from sands in 2016 found that only 46 % of trusts with maternity units provided mandatory bereavement care training for maternity unit staff. further, of those who did provide the training, 86 % provided their staff with just one hour or less of training each year. a separate report by bliss in 2015 on neonatal units found that 41 % of units had no access to trained mental health workers and that while some units had dedicated bereavement facilities, many relied on normal accommodation or quiet rooms. that is very important. in the case of 50 % of bereaved mothers, care after their baby had died was considered poor enough to have affected their psychosocial wellbeing and any plans that they might have for a future baby.', 'it is a pleasure to lead this debate this evening, and may i thank the minister for being here to respond? i never entered politics with the intention of becoming a baby loss awareness campaigner. as with so many in this field, the loss of a child - my son in 2014 - brought about my interest and desire to bring about change. and being a member of this house, gives every one of us the platform to make a difference. it can be a small change that affects just one of our constituents, or it can be something larger that affects everyone in the uk. i am proud that through my role in this house i have been able to play even just a small part in the development and roll - out of the national bereavement care pathway, which is something that will make a difference to tens of thousands of bereaved parents and families up and down the country. before i move on to the pathway itself, i want to pay tribute to you, mr speaker. you have been hugely supportive of our baby loss awareness campaigning efforts in this place, and i know i speak for all members of the all - party group on baby loss when i say a heart - felt thank you. launched last year at 11 sites across england, the pathway has been developed by a number of baby loss charities, royal colleges and professional organisations with the support of the department of health and social care and the appg. it is designed to improve the quality of bereavement care experienced by parents and families at all stages of pregnancy and baby loss up to 12 months. the pathway provides a practical framework for all those healthcare and other professionals involved and has been informed and led by the views of bereaved parents at every stage of its development.']"

to establish a financial inclusion fund, and provide for amounts received in such penalties to be paid into that fund ; and for connected purposes. recently link, which set the funding formula for atm operators, consulted its members on proposals to reduce from 25p to 20p the interchange fee paid to atm operators by banks when cash is withdrawn. the first phase of the cut will take place on 1 july 2018. this proposed reduction in the funding formula has led to concerns that many atms will become financially unviable and therefore may be forced to close or charge a fee to remain in use. the bill seeks to remove the option for atms to become fee - charging by banning fees. i take this position, first and foremost, out of principle, as i do not believe that anyone should have to pay to access their own money. however, a ban on atm charges makes it a practical necessity that an appropriate funding formula for free - to - use atms be devised. in supporting this objective, the bill seeks to provide a legal requirement for access to cash withdrawals through atms or other means where there is a demand for it. such demand would be established through a full market review of the atm network by the payment systems regulator. there has been no recent review of the demand for access to cash, and as we transition towards a cashless society it is important that we fully and comprehensively establish where demand remains for cash in order to target resources effectively.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the effect of atm closures on towns, high streets and rural communities. it is a pleasure to see you in the chair, mr hollobone. i and other hon. members on both sides of the house have been raising the closure of atms and its impact on our towns, high streets and rural communities for some time. the issue is more pressing than ever. in november 2017, link, the atm membership body that sets the funding for free - to - use atms, began consulting on proposed cuts to the funding mechanism known as the interchange rate fee - a fee paid to the atm operator, by the bank or company that issues a consumer ' s bank card, when cash is withdrawn. prior to link ' s reductions, that fee was 25p. in its consultation, link proposed reducing the fee to 20p through four rounds of cuts beginning on 1 july this year and ending in january 2021, although the third cut was cancelled and the fourth has been put under review. from the beginning, link accepted that those changes would lead to atm closures. in its analysis and consultation documents, it stated that it expected a decline of between 1 % and 11 % in free - to - use atms, but that it was confident that there would be a reduction only in areas with a high concentration of free - to - use atms, such as cities. however, the number of closures has been far higher - approximately 250 per month - since link announced its consultation. operators such as note machine and cardtronics say they expect to lose thousands of machines each, and new installations have been put on hold.""]"

the rationale for excluding flour from fortification is unclear. there is clearly strong support for that among members of the medical profession."", ""it is a pleasure to be here under your chairmanship, mr hanson. i congratulate the hon. member for pontypridd ( owen smith ) on securing this important debate and on the eloquent and cogent way that he set out the case for the fortification of flour with folic acid. when the facts are set out and the evidence is adduced, it is a very compelling case. it is all the more surprising, when one hears the weighted evidence of the arguments in favour of it, that something has not yet been done in this country to ensure the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid. the hon. gentleman said that that has happened in many major countries across the world with vast populations. he mentioned brazil, the united states and canada ; they are big countries with very strong regulatory regimes in which this practice has been carried out. therefore, there have been multiple opportunities to have all the scientific evidence evaluated and to have all the upsides and downsides considered. it is very clear that the upsides are so massive that they require this country to follow suit. it is a shame that we are not yet in a position in this country to have mandatory fortification of flour. it has been 27 years since the medical research council published its research demonstrating that supplementing women ' s diets with folic acid before the early stages of pregnancy reduced the chances of the pregnancy being affected by neural tube defects. that was in 1991. it was in 1990 that my son, andrew, was born with spina bifida. very soon after he was born, we became experts in the whole area of spina bifida : the reasons for it, how it develops and all the rest of it.""]"

just as for many other uk businesses, life has been difficult. the retail environment has been particularly challenging. the success of fair trade products in mainstream suppliers and their availability in supermarkets is welcome, but that challenges fair trade enterprises such as traidcraft on price and scale. much as we might like to escape the b - word, it is simply not possible. currency fluctuations immediately after the eu referendum and uncertainty about brexit continue to affect traidcraft. traidcraft estimates that the drop in the value of the pound within a week of the referendum cost the company a£350, 000. with most of the company ' s a£2.""]"

she did not. today she has been awarded a $ 3 million prize, which she has said she will use to set up a fund for women studying physics - thank you! the point made on a€œtodaya€ was that more diverse science partnerships are more robust and more successful. that goes for supporting women in science, but also for supporting co - operation and collaboration, and especially cross - border co - operation. i thank the government for the positive approach that they have taken to science. i am proud that more money is going into science and research under this government than under any other government for the past 40 years.""]"

the aspect of fees that i personally have greatest difficulty with is the profit that the home office makes on the applications. of the a£1, 012 that is charged, a£372 is the cost of administration and almost two thirds is profit. the free movement website estimates that the home office has made nearly a£100 million in profits over the past five years.', 'if the hon. gentleman allows me to make some progress, i will turn to the points he made in his opening speech. during 2017 - 18, about 64, 000 people were granted indefinite leave to remain and 123, 000 were granted citizenship. of those granted citizenship, more than 28, 000 were minor children who were registered and were related to a british citizen, or children granted citizenship on a discretionary basis. in all cases the applicants either paid the due fee or had that fee paid on their behalf, reflecting the value placed on permanent residence and citizenship in the uk. the charging framework for visa and immigration services delivered a£1. 35 billion of income in the last financial year, 2017 - 18. that helped to fund more than a£620 million of costs associated with other immigration system functions, helping to maintain their effectiveness and security, and investment in ongoing service improvement. setting fees at above the cost of processing an application has also helped us to set some fees at below cost - for example, short - term visit visas, in recognition of the significant economic benefits that tourists and other visitors bring to the whole of the uk. the subsidy for the circa 2. 5 million short - term visit visas issued each year costs in the region of a£90 million per annum, which can be afforded only by setting a wide range of other fees. let me make one other obvious point : setting fees at the level that we do - putting the burden on those who benefit from the services - reduces the burden on the exchequer and on the general taxpayers of this country. it is easy, particularly in opposition, to call for fees or taxes to be reduced, but a responsible government must balance the books. the loss of income that would result from any reduction in fees would have to be made up elsewhere, and there have been rather fewer suggestions of how that might be achieved.']"

the question is the extent to which they can be tailored or lifted to suit appropriate local circumstances. first, however, let me say something about accessibility issues. our london taxis have a fantastic record : all 21, 000 are wheelchair - accessible, but the story is not the same across the country. i am told that in metropolitan areas outside london, 83 % of taxis are wheelchair - accessible, but in some rural areas the figure falls as low as 15 %. one of the challenges that we face is making our taxi and private hire fleet more accessible to people throughout the country. there is a lot of variation in the approach to disability awareness training, which only 41 % of local authorities require for taxi drivers and only 38 % require for private hire vehicle drivers. over the past few years, the percentage of local authorities that require taxi and private hire vehicle drivers to complete training on the subject of child sexual abuse or exploitation has risen to 70 %, partly in response to some very sad incidents in some parts of the country. however, that leaves nearly 100 licensing authorities that still do not require drivers to undertake such training. i became interested in the subject when i had the privilege of serving as a shadow transport minister for a couple of years. when i later had the opportunity to introduce a private member ' s bill, i chose to try to do something about safety issues, on which there is cross - party consensus. since i introduced my bill - the licensing of taxis and private hire vehicles ( safeguarding and road safety ) bill - some 18 months ago, i have had the opportunity to discuss the issue with enforcement officers and officials from knowsley to london and with taxi and private hire firms from brighton to manchester.""]"

only a small number live in that very important community - and convincing him to leave because the back windows had dirt coming in and he was at risk of being crushed if he stayed in his own home. as the hon. member for angus mentioned, there are challenges in dealing with insurance companies. there is no doubt that we have significant challenges in coastal erosion the length and breadth of scotland and beyond, and it is vital that all the governments of the uk work together. i want to set the record straight on what the scottish government have done. i hope the hon. lady will be aware of the a£42 million a year that the scottish government have made available via the capital settlement since 2008 - that is, a£420 million - to enable local authorities to invest in flood prevention and coastal erosion works.', 'i thank my hon. friend for his intervention and i absolutely agree. there are huge studies going on in my constituency as well, because we need to do the groundwork, but we also need to have the funding ready for when those studies complete, so that we can go ahead with the work that needs to be done. of course, when it comes to coastal erosion, the waves do not respect local authority boundaries. erosion affects areas up and down the coastline and different local authorities face common and related problems. this is not something that should be left to local authorities alone ; there is space for a much more joined - up approach to erosion at all levels of government. however, such action must also be timely. i do not want to see montrose ending up as a cautionary tale for other parts of the coastline. unfortunately, the scottish government are risking that happening by leaving the implementation of further solutions to the 2022 to 2028 six - year plan for flood risk management. angus cannot wait until 2022, or until any time between 2022 and 2028. even by 2022, swathes of the angus coastline will have been lost. the risk of flooding and erosion to montrose, arbroath and other coastal communities in angus will be even more serious than it is today, and existing defences are being put under increasing and unbearable strain. it is the responsibility of local authorities, the devolved administrations and the uk government alike to start working together on the issue as a matter of urgency, so that we can quite literally hold back the tide that threatens so many of our coastal communities. the government are due to publish their updated national flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy next year, and within that i ask the minister to consider ways to make that work happen, ensuring that everyone involved in protecting our coasts around the whole uk is working effectively together.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered coastal erosion. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir david. the future of britain ' s coastline, and of our coastal communities, is finally getting the political attention that it deserves - not a moment too soon. from the need to curb plastic waste to prevent environmental damage to our shores to the opportunities that brexit presents for reviving our long - struggling fishing communities, britain ' s coasts are coming to the forefront of the political agenda. i am glad, because if our coastal communities are to benefit from this renewed focus on their future, we need to act now to ensure that they have a future. coastal erosion threatens large parts of britain ' s coasts and puts houses, businesses and entire communities at risk of flooding or, in some cases, total destruction. many hon. members will be familiar with this issue, as coastal erosion threatens about 17 % of the uk ' s coastline, specifically along the east coast. the environment agency estimates that more than 700 properties in england could be lost to coastal erosion by the 2030s, while in scotland, erosion is believed to pose a risk to a fifth of the coastline and the erosion rate has doubled since the 1970s. in 2013 and 2014, storms and extreme tides caused erosion that experts believed would never happen, but it has happened, and even quicker than they thought as it occurred almost overnight. businesses and individuals are increasingly concerned about the impact of the increasingly rapid degradation of our coastline. our coasts are vital areas and hubs of economic activity. as well as the obvious tourism draws, they are home to much of our crucial infrastructure. in scotland, the soft coastline, which is about 19 % of the total, and which is most at risk, includes roads, railways and scotland ' s water network.""]"

case scenario. that reflects the very challenging operating environment in eastern drc, which is a heavily populated area affected by insecurity. for example, last weekend an attack by armed groups on a monusco base was close to where a vaccination team were staying. thankfully, none of the ebola responders was injured, but they were moved to goma for a short period and vaccination activities had to be paused for a day. the scale of the response is also challenging. in addition to the 373 confirmed and probable cases, the drc government, supported by who and other implementing partners, is trying to trace some 4, 400 contacts on a daily basis. however, there is some encouraging news. the response is enabling faster detection of cases, laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of the spread of the disease.', ""first, i thank the minister for giving me advance sight of her statement. i share the government ' s deep concern about the outbreak of ebola in the democratic republic of the congo, and i am pleased to hear that a£25 million of uk aid has been given to the response. we hope that it goes some way to containing this deadly outbreak. in addition, supporting neighbouring countries to prepare to tackle the disease is fundamental and welcome. in 2014, we learned the hard way what happens when action is not taken fast enough to halt the cruel and deadly ebola virus. we all remember with great sadness how too many people tragically lost their lives in west africa, and none of us will ever forget the fear and chaos that the virus wreaked on the affected communities, and indeed right across the globe. i am sure we all agree that we must act now to avoid a repeat of those horrific scenes, and help the drc to contain this outbreak. with the world health organisation reporting that 213 people have died since 1 august in the drc, and the humanitarian agency ma©decins sans frontia¨res confirming 366 cases, let us be sure that dfid steps up and ensures that the uk plays a crucial leadership role alongside the international community in responding to this outbreak, just as we did in sierra leone four years ago. however, while emergency humanitarian response is an integral part of dfid ' s work, i am sure the minister agrees that prevention is better than emergency response. while we send aid to drc, we cannot and must not turn our backs on providing the long - term support that will ensure countries across the global south have appropriate health systems set up in the first place. it is deeply disappointing, therefore, that the minister ' s department dropped health spending from 18 % of dfid spend in 2014, to 12 % in 2017."", 'i will come on to the lessons learnt since the outbreak in sierra leone in a moment. however, i am sure that i cannot possibly have heard from the opposition front bench a statement to the effect that having a strong private sector is somehow in conflict with having the revenues needed to provide strong health systems around the world. i hope that that is not the considered position of those on the labour front bench. while spending on strengthening health systems around the world, particularly in some of the poorest and most fragile affected countries, it is important that we in the uk recognise the important role of growth and job creation in the ability of those countries to generate their own tax revenues so that they can continue to strengthen their own health systems. we think that that is the most important way to approach worldwide development. i digress from the topic at hand. the hon. lady mentions the outbreak in west africa. i draw the attention of the house to progress and lessons that have been learned since that outbreak. first, the importance of reacting quickly has been taken into account, both in the first outbreak in the drc earlier this year, which i am glad to say has been brought under control, and in this outbreak. importantly, the uk has ensured that the who has the resources it needs as soon as it needs them, because this is a clear case of where a quick reaction will save lives. one major milestone that has occurred since the outbreak in west africa is that the world has developed an experimental vaccine, which was deployed for the first time this year in the drc. it proved to be effective in the first outbreak. as i said, 31, 000 people have been given the experimental vaccine so far in this outbreak. one real challenge, however, is that this outbreak is in a conflict -

under the current voucher system, the amount of childcare a family gets is tied to their earnings."", 'it would be helpful if hon. members did not just make up statistics and facts as they went along, as we just heard from the hon. lady. hon. members should listen to us regarding the support that we are now providing to claimants. as i said, it is a topsy - turvy world. there was a ding - dong when the opposition were calling for the changes. now that we are introducing the changes, we are back to another ding - dong and they do not want the changes - but never mind. i turn to the regulations concerning national insurance contributions and childcare. these regulations align the tax and national insurance treatment of employer - supported childcare, where parents opt into the new tax - free childcare scheme. they remove the national insurance disregard to new entrants to the scheme, once the relevant day has been set. they are vital to ensure that the tax system operates fairly and consistently and that the government can target their childcare support effectively. for many parents, being able to afford good - quality childcare is essential for them to work and support their families. that is why we are replacing the childcare vouchers with tax - free childcare, which is a fairer and better - targeted system. tax - free childcare is now open to all eligible parents, who can get up to a£2, 000 per child per year to help towards their childcare costs. more families will be able to access support through tax - free childcare because only about half of employed working parents can access vouchers, and self - employed parents were excluded from vouchers. therefore, 1. 5 million families are now eligible for tax - free childcare compared with about 600, 000 families currently benefiting from vouchers.', ""let me make my introductory remarks, and then i will give way. let me draw members ' attention to the three key reasons why we support the replacement of childcare vouchers with tax - free childcare. first, the government believe that childcare vouchers are unfair. tax - free childcare is fairer and better targeted than the voucher scheme. for example, only about 5 % of employers offer vouchers, which limits their reach to about half of working parents, not to mention that self - employed parents are completely excluded from the scheme, which pays no regard to the number of children in each family and disadvantages lone - parent families. secondly, tax - free childcare has a broader reach. it is open to all working families with children aged under 12 that meet the earnings criteria. that ensures that families who were excluded from childcare vouchers can be brought into tax - free childcare, and benefits families with the highest childcare costs - namely, most of those with young children. thirdly, tax - free childcare is simpler to use - i will come to the it issues that members raised. employers usually pay third - party providers to administer childcare voucher schemes. the government do not believe that paying third - party providers is a good use of taxpayers ' money. some a£220 million has gone on such administration since the scheme began. a voucher scheme is therefore an ineffective way of delivering support to families. under tax - free childcare, parents manage their own accounts online. the case for change is clear, as it was to the labour party when it announced at its 2009 conference, when it was in government, that the existing system would be shut down. i will now happily give way to the hon. lady.""]"

we do not even have that north of the border. pregnancies for women with pku are extremely high risk. we have a slightly odd fail - first approach in this country, which can lead to serious defects and lifelong disabilities for children if they survive the pregnancy. the cost to the nhs of treating those disabilities over the life of the child is significantly more than the cost of kuvan for the mother during pregnancy. we have an odd approach to cost - effectiveness when looking at medicines in this country that i think we need to reassess. that is not only true for kuvan ; we have seen it when talking about orkambi and for various other issues.', 'i absolutely agree. i hope that one of the good things that will come out of this debate is that the buck stops being passed, and the assessment gets done as quickly as possible. it is so important for people to have access to this drug ; we need that to be sorted. there is evidence that for a significant proportion of people with pku - about 25 % - this drug can significantly improve their condition. it does not cure it, but it does make it much easier to deal with the dietary issues, which have such an impact on the way people live their lives. despite the drug having been around for so long, nhs england has only recently considered it for the management of pku. the drug has now been referred to nice for assessment and technology appraisal. the appg on pku recently heard from nice about the process, but there is concern about the timescales and how the benefits of the treatment will be assessed. understandably, there is huge frustration on the part of the pku community that there are children and adults who could be benefiting from kuvan now, and there is substantial evidence to support its benefits. there is a particular issue about prescribing kuvan for pregnant women with pku, who can understandably find it hugely difficult to control their diet, and who fear the effect of any problems on their unborn child. while there is a 2013 commissioning policy in place that allows kuvan to be prescribed to some pregnant women, it can be difficult for women to be prescribed it in a timely way. some people, some of whom are in this room, have had access to kuvan through individual funding requests, or on a trial basis. those people have found real benefits from the drug. my constituent archie, who is here, started on the treatment earlier this year.']"

sponsored terror. my hon. friend the member for vauxhall ( kate hoey ) said quite clearly and accurately that this is not a party political issue, but it is one of justice. she told the house of a harrowing case. victims were told that this was a private matter, but she does not believe that and nor should we. the hon. member for south suffolk ( james cartlidge ) drew our attention to a 22 - year - old woman police officer who was killed in the 1983 bombing of harrods. a united states citizen was eventually compensated by libya for that same outrage. the hon. gentleman wants similar legislation to that which has now been passed by congress in the united states -

the second is from the hon. member for tewkesbury, the former chair of the northern ireland affairs committee, who said : a€œthe uk government cannot allow this litany of missed chances to continue. there needs to be direct dialogue with the libyan government, and if the situation there makes this impossible, the government must begin the process of establishing a fund themselves. a€i would be interested to hear the minister ' s comments. i want to make it clear that labour members -

improving our trading relations with japan means reducing the cost for british businesses wanting to trade with japan and opening our businesses up to new and exciting opportunities. for places such as stoke - on - trent, this is not something new. we have a long and proud history of economic links with japan. many british ceramicists have imitated and developed the styles of the fine japanese porcelain dating from the early 19th century.""]"

quality parks and green spaces now and for future generations. the government are committed to ensuring that our parks and open spaces continue to provide vibrant and inclusive places for local communities to enjoy. local parks are great at connecting communities and encouraging interaction between younger and older generations and between people from different backgrounds. i recognise that to achieve that shared goal we need to support local councils to deliver it, so it may be helpful if i set out what the government are doing to support the hon. lady ' s local area and, more broadly, if i touch on some of the activity the government are undertaking to safeguard parks and open spaces. on overall funding for local government, this government believe strongly that local people who know and understand their community are best placed to decide how funding should be spent in their area. that is why funding provided through the local government finance settlement is largely not ring - fenced, as it allows local authorities, which are independent of central government, to manage their budgets in line with local priorities. in practice, that means there is no specific funding stream for parks, just as there is not for waste services or children ' s services, for example. local communities are best placed to decide on their own local priorities."", ""even amidst the most built - up cities, we are blessed with parks and pockets of green space. those spaces improve air quality, lower temperatures near congested cities and even harbour wildlife, but they are also the lifeblood of our communities. as we face an obesity crisis and concerns over public health, parks offer free and accessible opportunities for exercise and enjoyment. at a time when families are living in ever more cramped conditions and unsuitable housing, parks provide a much - needed environment in which children without access to other opportunities can enjoy being children. in an era of extreme loneliness and isolation, they are bringing people of all ages together, and in an age of unprecedented privatisation and commercialisation of public space, they remain free for everyone to use and benefit from. according to the indices of multiple deprivation, my constituency is one of the most deprived in the country. government figures suggest that we might expect to see far fewer parks and open spaces in such areas than in wealthier areas. however, sheffield, brightside and hillsborough, despite its legacy as a highly urban formerly industrial area, is an exception to this, having substantial areas of parks and open space across the constituency. sheffield can lay claim to being the greenest city in europe, with a third of our city boundary lying within the peak district and a history of prestigious prizes won, including the 2005 entente florale gold medal. we are blessed with hundreds of parks and open spaces, and residents have access to a huge range of facilities, from small play parks to ancient woodlands. the national trust funded research in 2016 on sheffield ' s parks, which highlighted the huge value and benefit they hold for local people and the financial value that they represent to health and other public services."", 'i absolutely agree. that is the thrust of my speech tonight, and i have already detailed the effects of cuts to budgets for policing and public services. it would be easy to ask the minister to consider making parks statutory services, so that councils could be held to account more easily for their maintenance. however, my local parks would not be helped one bit by that without the government backing up the change with serious funding for local authorities to meet this requirement. labour and the conservatives have different views about local authority funding, and i do not think that we will resolve this difference tonight. as much as local authorities can innovate in developing and maintaining parks, it appears to be an unfortunate truth that there will always be higher costs. i ask the minister specifically to ensure that councils have enough capital funds to create parks that are resilient to the challenges they can face. i also ask him to work with the minister for sport to ensure that lottery funds specifically support parks facing difficulties with misuse and the lack of commercial income that i have outlined. as welcome as the a€œparks for peoplea€ programme was, its focus on heritage meant that parks in the most challenging areas sometimes lost out in favour of parks in traditionally leafier suburbs. i thank members and the minister for attending tonight. i also thank local people, interested organisations and local parks officers who all offered a wealth of information, so much of which i could not touch on tonight. i hope that i can make a small contribution to ensuring that we have resilient parks and green spaces in every part of my constituency and in every city. maintaining and improving parks for every citizen is an absolute necessity if we want to create a more equal, healthy and happy society.']"

will the minister tell me if any geothermal projects have been awarded to contracts for difference during either of the allocation rounds to date? there are mature geothermal renewable technologies providing heat and electricity that should and must play their part in the decarbonisation of our energy networks.""]"

we will retain the bonds of friendship, security and trade that have united britain and europe for so long. if we want to achieve that, before we leave the european union we must put in place the essential legal powers and structures that will enable the uk to operate an independent trade policy. that is what our trade legislation is designed to achieve. in this, as in all our legislation, the department for international trade will be guided by what delivers the greatest economic advantage to the uk and ensures the continued confidence of our partners and allies. the bill contains six delegated powers allowing the government to make regulations to support and develop their trade policy. two of the powers allow the government to amend primary legislation ; they relate to ensuring the continuity of eu trade agreements into a uk - only context and to the collection of exporter information by her majesty ' s revenue and customs. both powers are subject to significant restrictions on how they can be used. the trade agreement continuity powers are limited in scope ; in particular, they can be used to amend primary legislation only when it forms part of retained eu law. we intend to use the powers to make necessary amendments to domestic legislation as part of the transition project. by taking those powers, we can be sure that we have the ability to implement efficiently all obligations of existing trade agreements in our new context. the eu ' s trade agreements, which we intend to transition and which are within the scope of this bill, will have already been scrutinised by parliament ' s eu committees. free trade agreements that the uk has already ratified have also been through the normal parliamentary scrutiny process."", 'i rise to speak in favour of denying the bill a second reading, for two simple reasons. the first is that the bill would simply not be necessary were the prime minister and her shambolic cabinet to reverse their masochistic and deeply misguided decision to reject the option of a soft brexit by making leaving the eu single market and customs union such a red line in their negotiations with the eu27. the second reason is that the bill fails to provide for a proper role for parliament in the scrutiny and approval of the replacement trade agreements. the secretary of state spoke earlier about his apparent commitment to openness and transparency, yet the procedure outlined in the bill, far from being an improvement on eu scrutiny processes, is significantly worse in that respect. in the uk, trade agreements can be negotiated entirely under royal prerogative powers, giving the government free rein to decide when and with whom to start negotiations, to decide their own priorities and objectives, to conduct negotiations in deep secrecy and to conclude an agreement without any meaningful scrutiny by parliament at all. we in this house are therefore in a much worse position than our colleagues in the european parliament or, indeed, the us congress. that not only sidelines members of this house, but prevents input from the public and civil society organisations. that is a huge democratic deficit that must be corrected. the second point to make is that ministers might well be absolutely wrong in suggesting that this is simply a case of rolling over existing eu trade agreements. as other hon. members have made clear, plenty of countries with which we have trade agreements might not wish to be rolled over in that way, and they might have strong views about changing those agreements. indeed, paragraph 53 of the explanatory notes states thata€œthe new uk third country agreements that are implemented througha€this billa€œwill be legally distinct from the eu.', ""indeed, i do rise to speak to new clause 3, which is in my name and signed by more than 50 members of the house from four different parties, and i give notice that i would like to move it when it comes to the votes. this amendment essentially seeks to remedy the bill ' s failure to provide for a proper role for parliamentarians in the scrutiny and approval of trade agreements. at present, trade agreements can be negotiated, or renegotiated as is likely to be the case with many of the existing eu trade deals covered by this bill, entirely under royal prerogative powers, essentially giving the government free rein to decide when and with whom to start negotiations, to set their own priorities and objectives, to conduct the negotiations in great secrecy, and to conclude the deal without any meaningful parliamentary scrutiny. that not only sidelines members of this house, but it prevents valuable input by civil society organisations and the wider public. this bill is supposed to help implement an independent trade policy following withdrawal from the eu, but it does nothing to put in place the kind of scrutiny and approval framework that should be required for an accountable trade policy in a modern democratic country. and this is the only legislative opportunity we are likely to have to put such a framework in place. in his statement yesterday, the secretary of state for international trade once again sought to make a distinction between replacements for existing eu trade deals and future trade deals, but the fact is that effective parliamentary scrutiny and approval is needed for both, for it is increasingly clear that, contrary to the hope of ministers, it is not going to be a simple case of transitioning, or a€œrolling over, a€ existing eu trade deals. some or all of the countries in question are not simply going to be content to continue with the existing arrangements, and ministers will have little choice but to negotiate a replacement deal.""]"

hon. members who were here under the coalition government talked about having an elected house of lords, but they could not agree on one simple solution. the lords are talking about reform, and i will cover that point in a second. the hon. member for glasgow east ( david linden ) talked about hereditary peers. the daft thing is that, with the 92 who are left, it is a halfway house. i understand why people are concerned about the house of lords and either want to change it or question its legitimacy. in 2016, we had a ridiculous situation when there was a by - election for one of the members of the house of lords. a lib dem peer, lord avebury, died, and seven hereditary peers from around the country were put up for election, but the electorate was only three. how daft is it to have an electorate that is half the size of the field of candidates? it makes a mockery of the process, so we clearly need to look at the situation. the government have already gone some way towards trying to lay a path to change. the house of lords reform act 2014 allowed members, for the first time, to retire or resign permanently. those who do not attend or are convicted of a serious offence that carries a prison sentence of a year or more cease to be members. that was not the case before. again, it is a bit daft and i am glad it was sorted out. the house of lords ( expulsion and suspension ) act 2015 enabled a suspension running beyond the end of a parliament to be imposed on a member, and allowed the house of lords to expel members.']"

that is to say that the bill lists a series of different offences that, when perpetrated against an emergency worker, will be considered to be aggravated. when i drew up the bill, i was primarily thinking of physical violence towards emergency workers. but the truth is that, since i have been working on the bill, my hon. friend the member for halifax and i have received lots of representations, particularly from health service workers, about the sexual assault of ambulance workers, nurses, mental health nurses, doctors and others. one difficulty, both for the government and for us, has been that these statistics have never been gathered by nhs protect, which no longer exists anyway. however, the numbers of such incidents reported by the trade unions working on this matter are quite dramatic, particularly given that the figures show increases. since 2012, such incidents are up 143 % in the east of england ambulance service ; up 40 % in london ; up 133 % in the north west ambulance service ; and up 1500 % in northern ireland.', ""absolutely. in return for the hon. gentleman ' s sense and solidarity in not pressing the amendment, we will focus on making sure that the relevant authorities, particularly the cps, are clearly instructed to consider spitting as included under common assault. i hope that in a small way this speech in the house of commons will re - emphasise, in case anyone is in any doubt, that it is parliament ' s intention that spitting should always be included within the offence of common assault. that brings us to the amendment and various new clauses tabled by my hon. friend the member for shipley, which would further increase the penalty for assaulting emergency workers, police officers and prison officers. this is a complex set of new clauses. new clauses 1 and 2 relate to the existing law - in particular the police act 1996, as it relates to a police officer in the execution of their duty - and seek to do two things. the first is to increase the maximum penalty from six months to 12 months. on that, we respectfully argue that if the bill passes today, we will have already increased to 12 months the maximum penalty for such an assault on a police officer in the exercise of their functions. it would therefore be unnecessary to further amend the police act. the aim of new clause 2 and amendment 9 is to double the maximum penalty from 12 months to 24 months either by amending the police act or dealing with the criminal justice act 2003. the government wish to resist this approach because we have to weigh up two principles. on the one hand, we believe very strongly that emergency workers are entitled to a particular form of respect and protection because they work on our behalf - they provide services to us ; they represent us."", 'there are two aspects to the bill. the first is the offence of common assault, which i think is now drawn in such a way that the courts will be able to circumvent some of the arguments that have thus far been used to prevent any kind of successful prosecution. the second aspect relates to the aggravated offence, and the hon. gentleman is absolutely right that we have not included every single offence in the world. if amendment 3 is accepted this morning, i think that we will have included all offences that could relate to emergency workers. the minister was right to say that it is important that we take cognisance of the fact that, with this bill, we are saying that emergency workers are going to be treated slightly differently in law from the rest of the wider public. it is not that i want to create great hierarchies in society, with some people being more important than others ; it is that emergency workers are suffering these attacks and assaults because they are emergency workers, and that places a greater onus on us to ensure that they have the protections that they need. i return to amendment 2 and the question of whether spitting is common assault. the sentencing council has in recent years looked at whether spitting increases the culpability and seriousness of the offence, and it removed spitting from each of those categories in 2012. quite a lot of magistrates and judges have now started to say that this is one of the primary reasons that there has been a deflation in the number of successful prosecutions and in the sentences that are handed down. i regret the fact that spitting was removed by the sentencing council and hope that it will revisit that decision in the near future. i hope that the minister might also be able to say something about how we can ensure that the courts take spitting seriously as a part of common assault offences.']"

definition of gender is already happening. organisations seem to be ahead of the law, which the government may or may not be about to change. there is a particular concern about what is going on in schools with children.']"

i am seeking a commitment from the commonwealth games federation to include shooting in the 2026 games. we need to look forward and ensure that what has happened this time does not happen again. the minister referred to david calvert in her intervention. he will shortly be competing in brisbane, and my hon. friend the member for belfast east ( gavin robinson ) was inspired by him many years ago. i am sure that many other young boys and girls were inspired by him as well. that is why i am raising this issue today. two key international bodies oversee the shooting sports that appear in the commonwealth games : the international shooting sport federation and the international confederation of fullbore rifle associations. both have indicated a willingness to work with the cgf to find a solution to keep shooting sports in the games and on the 2022 programme. both are willing to do more than most, and representatives met the cgf president in february this year. this is about finding solutions. when people come to me with problems, it is not about the problem ; it is about the solution. we bring the issue to the floor of the house to seek a solution, and we hope that that solution will be forthcoming. at olympic level, the issf represents a category c sport, recognising its growing and significant contribution to the olympic ideals and family. having four disciplines, shooting sports can be delivered flexibly, both in terms of which disciplines appear and in terms of location.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the removal of shooting sports from birmingham 2022 commonwealth games. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr hanson. i would like to push forward with the efforts started by the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) - i am pleased to see him present - to make the case for the reinstatement of shooting sports at the 2022 commonwealth games in birmingham. i have picked up many of the points raised during his adjournment debate, and i will expand on them in the wake of the home nations ' phenomenal performance at the gold coast commonwealth games this year. the decision not to include shooting in the 2022 commonwealth games in birmingham has left many in the uk, particularly in my constituency, confused and unhappy. the matter is of particular importance to a constituent of mine, david mcmath, a 21 - year - old young man who recently won gold in the men ' s double trap competition at the games this year. he set a games record with a total of 74 - four ahead of his nearest rival, tim kneale from the isle of man, who took silver. without a doubt, shooting is a source of extreme national pride for the home nations of the united kingdom, as it is one of our strongest sports. in fact, we are the second strongest group in shooting events and managed to collect 38 % of the medals on offer this year. not adding shooting to the 2022 games has taken away 57 medal opportunities. every one of the home nations and channel islands participated in the shooting events, which proves the sport ' s popularity. in fact, it was the only sport for which the isle of man won a medal this year."", 'the hon. gentleman makes very good points and i agree with him. manchester used bisley in 2002, although it is 215 miles from the shooting ground. i therefore argue that it can be done and that bisley can provide the required facilities. i concede that bisley is not in tip - top condition, but the venue remains fully operational and would require only light modernisation to bring it up to scratch. with 95 % of the competition venues already in place, minor refurbishment of the bisley shooting ground would not add an unfeasible workload to the games organisers. a second solution is to build a new site alongside the new national shooting centre for which uk sport and british shooting are currently securing funding and planning permission. if the organisers of the birmingham games were to link funding to the national governing body, it would be a fantastic opportunity to ensure that the games leave a lasting legacy. shooting is currently on a list of optional sports, from which the host city must choose seven. the organisers of birmingham 2022 have opted to include table tennis, for which england has only ever won 15 medals. that pales in comparison with the 168 medals won for shooting. they have also opted for 3x3 basketball, which is a novelty in the commonwealth games. i think shooting is a more important sport. given that i have just presented a counter - argument and an alternative option to the venue issue cited by the birmingham organisers, i see no logical reason why england would want to cheat herself of a significant number of medals by removing shooting from the agenda. shooting has been on the commonwealth games agenda at every games bar 1970. it was originally introduced in 1966 and, as my hon. friend the member for wyre forest ( mark garnier ) has said, it is one of the most diverse and inclusive sports on offer.']"

it must be separate from the nhs to ensure real independence, and it must investigate and act on concerns. if a local investigation has failed or is failing, there should be a mechanism to report that to an independent body. if we get to the point where there is simply a slanging match within a trust, there will never be a satisfactory resolution, so arbitration needs to come in and look at the cold facts and the original facts of the disclosure. often, what is looked at is the process, but not whether the whistleblower was actually right to raise an issue in the first place. it is critical that whistleblowers are protected from detriment from the moment of speaking up. they should be protected during the investigation, and they must not be picked on either subtly, as the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) said, or blatantly - they must not lose their jobs. it is important that legal penalties for reprisals against whistleblowers can actually be enforced. there should be a system of redress for whistleblowers that does not involve litigation. litigation is expensive for the nhs and the whistleblower, and is utterly confrontational.']"

i mean giving us a simple answer on whether consumer debt is higher or lower. my understanding from bank of england and office for budget responsibility data is that consumer credit - unsecured loans - is up by 19 % since 2010. car financing - a huge new area of secured personal debt - has added a£30 billion in the same timeframe. student debt under this government has doubled to nearly a£100 billion. in real terms, there has been a 7 % increase since 2010 in consumer personal debt - the second highest figure in the g8 economies after that in canada. some clarification on that point would be welcome. it is estimated that over 8 million adults in the uk struggle with problem personal debt - the issue we are debating today - resulting in bankruptcy or individual voluntary arrangements. many people are in that situation because of unexpected life events, be that a job loss, an illness or a breakdown in relationships. the debt charity step change, which has been mentioned on multiple occasions in the debate, estimates that 60 % of its clients were able to stabilise their financial position after a voluntary freezing of interest charges and enforcement action by their creditors, so it is clear that a breathing space scheme can make a real difference to the lives of people struggling with problem personal debt."", 'i completely agree with my hon. friend. the idea is that this is just a problem for a few hundred thousand people, but debt, worrying about debt and the causes of debt are mainstream concerns in this country. debt management, debt advice and the work of citizens advice is very important, but i also believe that, when we see these problems growing again, there is a role for us to step in before they get any worse. i made a call to action several years ago about payday lenders. we did not listen then until it was too late. i hope the government will listen now. we know that not everybody is struggling, and that britain is a nation of contrasts, where some people have seen their wealth balloon because of property and pension rights. however, we also know that there are too many for whom debt is just everyday life. it is debt on basic payments - on food, rent and travelling to work costs. we know that 25 % of the uk population now struggles with debt. not everybody is in trouble, but enough are, and the reason is the nature of the products they use to deal with their debt, particularly credit cards. i hope the minister will understand why we need to act, because credit cards are the acceptable face of modern debt for people. all of us have one ; i am sure if members were to open up their wallets and purses, they would have, if not one, then maybe two or three with them. there are 30 million cardholders in the united kingdom. indeed, the financial conduct authority has been investigating the credit card market.']"

that is a 24 % improvement. between 2016 and 2018 the proportion of pupils reaching the expected standards has risen from 66 % to 75 % in reading tests and from 70 % to 76 % in maths. opposition members do not like hearing this stuff. critically, the gap between disadvantaged pupils and others in secondary schools narrowed by 10 % between 2011 and 2017. my right hon. friend the schools minister opened the debate by talking about many of those figures and commenting on the impact of the improvements in teaching and learning. i pay tribute to king ' s college in my constituency, which has made a massive improvement. in the words of ofsted, a€œstaff have transformed the atmosphere in the school through raising expectations of pupils ' behaviour. a€principal alastair mckenzie should rightly, along with the staff, be proud of what he has achieved."", ""it is a pleasure to serve, for what i think is the first time, under your chairmanship of one of these debates in westminster hall, mr sharma. i congratulate the hon. member for warrington north ( helen jones ) on arranging the debate and on opening it with such articulate and strong content. this government came to office determined to raise standards in our schools. that has been the driving force behind all our educational reforms. we want to close the attainment gap between those from disadvantaged backgrounds and their more advantaged peers, and our reforms are beginning to show results. more schools are rated good or outstanding by ofsted. some 1. 9 million more pupils are now in those schools, benefiting from a higher quality of education than they would have done in 2010. thanks to our phonics reforms, we are rising up the international league tables for the reading ability of nine and 10 - year - olds. we have risen from joint 10th to joint eighth in the progress in international reading literacy survey. the attainment gap between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their more affluent peers has closed by 10 % in primary and secondary schools. however, many if not most of our reforms were opposed by the labour party, and today ' s debate is just one more example of that opposition. when we came into office in 2010, we began the process of reforming the national curriculum and gcses and a - levels in response to concerns about grade inflation in our public exams and concerns from employers, colleges and universities about academic standards in our schools. we went through a long process. we appointed an expert panel. we worked with the exam boards in drafting subject content, and we consulted widely on that content. the exam boards went through the process of providing exam specifications. the first exams in english and maths were ready for teaching in september 2015, more than five years after the reform process began."", ""there is nothing more important to the future of a child than a rigorous academic education in an orderly, safe and nurturing environment - an education that allows every child to fulfil their potential and equips them with the knowledge of the world around them so that they can take on the challenges of that world, an education steeped in the achievements of generations of scientists, and the literature, music and art that lies at the heart of our humanity, and an education system that ensures that they have the language, literacy and maths skills that enable them to function and to learn more. that should be the start of every child ' s life, whether that child is from a wealthy family or a family on a low income, whether they are in the north or the south - west, or whether they are in london or in manchester. that has been the driving force of this government since 2010 : to raise standards in our schools ; to improve the curriculum ; to put our education system on a par with the best in the world ; to close the attainment gap between those from different backgrounds ; and to ensure that every child is a fluent reader long before they leave primary school. our reform programme has been opposed by the labour party every step of the way. in office, those complacent, ideological enemies of promise and close - knit friends of the vested interests presided over grade inflation, falling standards and an education system that left too many children starting secondary school still struggling with reading and basic arithmetic, because labour was too afraid to challenge the status quo. labour failed to introduce fairer funding because it was controversial. we have not shirked our responsibility. the new national funding formula ensures that every pupil in the country is funded on the same basis according to need. the hon. member for stoke - on - trent central ( gareth snell ) needs to read up about that.""]"

party parliamentary china group, i congratulate others for joining in the debate and for expressing our concern about human rights, democracy and individual freedoms. as we reflect on the past 20 years, it is important to pay tribute to the hong kong government for the significant steps forward they have taken since handover, from minimum wage legislation to anti - corruption drives, clean water initiatives and huge investments in public infrastructure projects. as we look forward to the next 20 years, we should pause to remember the past 20, and how important the principles of the joint declaration are for the flourishing of hong kong ' s economy and society. the dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit of the hong kong people has allowed hong kong to flourish under the joint declaration. there is no reason why that should not continue. the uk - hong kong relationship has deepened. more than 600 uk businesses with registered offices in hong kong, an export market worth a£8. 6 billion and a uk investment stake of more than a£33 billion are clear signs that trade is booming. in terms of academic and cultural exchange, more hong kong students are enrolling at uk universities than ever before, which is an achievement to celebrate. in part, the relationships we form with students, young people and young democrats redouble our efforts to commit ourselves to a more socially just society based on individual freedoms and human rights. we are all aware of the high -

it resists scrutiny, undermines scottish parliamentary committees, and has subverted the freedom of information process in scotland. but it is right during this debate that we speak about the services that could have been provided with the money allocated for the last financial year had it been spent - the healthcare that could have been provided to the sick, the educational equipment that could have been bought for our students, and the roads that could have been fixed or repaired for our motorists by the scottish government. the scottish taxpayer is now the highest taxed of all taxpayers in these islands. of course, i defend the right of the snp scottish government to set their spending priorities according to the priorities they have set for that government. that is their prerogative.']"

christmas has come early for me. happy christmas to everyone, and thank you to all the staff who run this place. i have said that now, so i will not repeat it. i want to raise the subject of the danger caused by a drug called isotretinoin, which i have already spoken about - perhaps four times - in the house since becoming an mp. to date, i have to say, the collective view of the house has had little impact on actually sorting it out. isotretinoin, also known as accutane or roaccutane, is a drug used to treat severe acne primarily in teenagers - mainly boys. it has dramatic effects : it clears acne up pretty quickly, but its side - effects can be enormous. it can cause severe depression and impotence in those who use it. my concerns stem from contact with constituents, particularly one lady. she is the mother of a young man who has suffered enormously from isotretinoin. at the age of 16, he was given the drug for eight months. as a result, he suffered - forgive my language - complete erectile dysfunction, which has had a life - changing effect on him and, indeed, on his mental state. he is now in his early 20s, and it has of course had a dramatic effect on him. he has been through university, too. unsurprisingly, his mother is distraught, in particular because her son is now almost unwilling even to discuss the matter. i believe that we can all understand that. it must be very difficult for a young man to discuss such a matter with his mother. i, personally - i know i am from another generation - could not even have dreamt of talking about such a matter with my mother.', 'i beg to move, that this house has considered the risks of the use of accutane. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir roger. i particularly wish to speak about the impact of accutane, which can cause depression and impotence when used to treat severe acne. accutane is but one of a series of drugs, each based on isotretinoin. there are several versions of isotretinoin, known variously as accutane, roaccutane, claravis, sotret and amnesteem. these versions of isotretinoin all perform in much the same way. since all five drugs stem from isotretinoin, and indeed the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency - mhra - uses that name, i will use it to cover all five of them collectively. originally, isotretinoin was marketed as a chemotherapy drug. based on the evidence of friends who have undergone chemotherapy, i am immediately warned to watch out for side effects. i do not suffer any more from teenage acne or have the urgent need to get it under control that could easily make me overcome misgivings in a bid to get rid of such a curse. the effects of isotretinoin were last debated on 3 december 2013 in this very place. i took part in that debate because i was concerned to hear about the effects of isotretinoin on the nephew of one of my then constituents. worries about the effects of isotretinoin had been debated in parliament some 10 years before that. this seems to be a problem that will not go away and for which we have no scientifically based answer. i was spurred to call this debate by a constituent who prefers to remain anonymous, but whose son - a totally happy young man - has had his life totally disrupted since taking isotretinoin for severe acne.']"

operation is therefore actively supporting business and tourism by removing a barrier to people ' s life choices. arguably the greatest beneficiaries of these arrangements are our citizens who live on the continent, many of whom are enjoying their golden years in the sun. the framework put in place by the bill will ensure that the secretary of state has the necessary power to maintain or negotiate arrangements in any brexit eventuality. one of my constituents recently emphasised the importance of having these arrangements. his grandmother, who is now over 80, lives alone in france. a few years ago, she had a car accident that left her seriously injured. she required an operation and spent over a month in hospital. that was followed up by time in a convalescent home. all that care would have cost a small fortune but, luckily for her, she enjoys healthcare under the european health insurance card s1 route. access to that is fundamental to her and to the other 190, 000 pensioners like her, particularly as their health needs may increase over time. the bill should calm the anxieties of our citizens abroad. it will also save the taxpayer money."", 'i am grateful for this opportunity to close the debate on behalf of labour. it is clear that members on both sides of the house understand the importance of the bill. the uk currently enjoys reciprocal agreements for the provision of healthcare with all the nations of the european union. under existing arrangements, the healthcare of 190, 000 uk state pensioners living abroad - principally in ireland, spain, france and cyprus - and their dependent relatives is protected. in addition, uk residents who visit the eu or the european economic area on holiday or to study may use the european health insurance card to access healthcare for emergency treatment and healthcare needs that arise during their stay. anyone who is ordinarily resident in the uk qualifies for an ehic and 250, 000 claims for medical treatment are made each year under this scheme. by the same token, eu nationals visiting the uk can use their ehic to receive free care from the nhs for any emergency healthcare needs and for healthcare needs that arise during their stay. i am grateful to the hon. member for chelmsford ( vicky ford ) for reminding the house that the card does not cover repatriation and other associated expenses, but visitors to the eu can currently be reassured that their immediate emergency costs will be met. that is something that we would seek to protect. by means of the s1 form and the ehic, current arrangements also provide for the healthcare of employees of uk companies and organisations working in the eu and the eea, as well as for that of frontier workers living there, and vice versa. importantly, the agreement also provides funding for uk residents to travel overseas to receive planned treatment in other countries - for example, for procedures unavailable in the uk within a medically justifiable timescale, or to return home to give birth.', 'i beg to move, that the bill be now read a second time. this is a short bill, with six clauses, to enable continuity of healthcare for british nationals and eu citizens after britain leaves the european union. it is clearly in the interests of the british public to ensure reciprocal healthcare arrangements continue when we leave the eu, whether that happens through an agreement with the eu itself or through individual agreements with eu member states. by enabling us to implement those arrangements, the bill will help us to help nearly 200, 000 british pensioners living in eu countries to continue to access the medical treatment that they need, and it will mean that the hundreds of thousands of british citizens who require medical treatment each year during holidays in europe can still be covered for medical assistance when they need it. the bill will help to ensure that uk nationals who live and work in eu countries can continue to access healthcare on the same basis as local people. it will mean that eu citizens can be covered for reciprocal healthcare here, so that the uk continues to be a place tourists want to visit and vital workers, such as our nhs workforce, want to live in. the bill will also mean that we can continue to recover healthcare costs from europe as we do now.']"

i think, and our committee agrees - in a far too narrow way. the charity commission guidance for students unions indicated that it would consider it acceptable for charitable students unions to comment ona€œstreet lighting near the campusa€because the issue affects students as students, and therefore fulfils their charitable purposes. the charity commission would consider it unacceptable for students unions to comment publicly on issues that do not directly affect the welfare of students as students, such as, a€œthe treatment of political prisoners in a foreign country. a€that is the charity commission ' s own example, illustrating the point raised by my hon. friend the member for stafford. the minister told our committee that the charity commission guidance shoulda€œgo further and facilitate the promotion of free speech. it should be giving students ' unions the permission to host debates about controversial issues and expose students to a wide range of viewpoints. that should be the core purpose. a€that is quite right."", ""this inquiry is one of the most important that we have undertaken in my three years on the joint committee on human rights. as we have heard, we received some very disturbing evidence. free speech is indeed a foundation for democracy in society, and universities are places where many of tomorrow ' s leaders learn how to explore ideas in a way that prepares them to engage in and influence wider society, so it is critical that free speech is secured in universities. a key part of all students ' education is the ability to engage in dialogue and contentious debate. universities have a legal duty under the education act to secure freedom of speech within the law, both for students and for visiting speakers. if we do not prepare students to engage in dialogue in an environment that promotes free speech, there is a serious danger that we will risk promoting extremism and factionalism within wider society. only by understanding different views and beliefs and by, as one of our witnesses said, countering bad ideas with good ones, will we build community cohesion and break down prejudice and discrimination in wider society, which, at worst, as we know, can lead to violent disturbances within our local communities. that is something that none of us wants. indeed, it is one of the purposes of the prevent strategy. it is ironic that the strategy is in many ways defeating one of its key objectives in the way that it is applied at universities. i will come on to that in more detail shortly. for the record, i will set the legal scene, which the committee is now well versed in. article 9 of the european convention on human rights states that, a€œeveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion."", ""that is an excellent example. i hope it will also encourage students to the right of karl marx, because i have spoken to a number of students who have recently said, a€œi wouldn ' t admit to being a conservative on campus. a€our committee concluded that the concept of safe spaces, having been extended to entire university campuses, is unhelpful. it is not only unhelpful. if minority views are supressed across the whole campus, but they are not views that are promoting terrorism or inciting the kind of activity i referred to earlier, the concept is actually against the law, impinging on the right to free speech under article 10 of the european convention on human rights. a number of students unions tried to argue in evidence to us that it was necessary to limit speakers who cause harm through speech - harm caused because people might find speech disturbing or upsetting. as our report says, however, this is counter or detrimental to free speech. regarding safe spaces, we say : a€œwhilst there must be opportunities for genuinely sensitive and confidential discussions in university settings, and whilst the original intention behind safe space policies may have been to ensure that minority or vulnerable groups can feel secure, in practice the concept of safe spaces has proved problematic, often marginalising the views of minority groups. they need to co - exist with and respect free speech. they cannot cover the whole of the university or university life without impinging on rights to free speech... when that happens, people are moving from the need to have a a€œsafe spacea€ to seeking to prevent the free speech of those whose views they disagree with. minority groups or individuals holding unpopular opinions which are within the law should not be shut down nor be subject to undue additional scrutiny by students ' unions or universities.""]"

when will sir charles godfray ' s review of the government ' s tb policy be published? will it consider the use of vaccination as an alternative to shooting? some horrific video footage has been obtained from the badger cull area in cumbria. a caged badger was shot and took almost a minute to die, writhing in agony. the shooter then flagrantly disregarded the biosecurity guidelines, took the badger out of the cage and failed to bag it up - little wonder that the government ' s policy has not been particularly successful in reducing the spread of tb."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the badger cull. it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir david, in a debate on this very important issue, because i know that you take a close interest in it. however, i am amazed that five years after the badger cull started we are still debating it. if you will bear with me, sir david, i remember speaking on this issue on 5 june 2013. i quoted lord krebs, who chaired a review team that originated the idea of the randomised badger culling trial. he was interviewed on the a€œtodaya€ programme on 12 october 2012, and said : a€œthe scientific case is as clear as it can be : this cull is not the answer to tb in cattle. a€i have found no scientists who are experts in population biology or in the distribution of infectious diseases in wildlife who think that culling is a good idea. people seem to have cherry - picked certain results to try to support their argument. i also quoted lord robert may, a former government chief scientist and president of the royal society, who said : a€œit is very clear to me that the government ' s policy does not make sense... i have no sympathy with the decision. they are transmuting evidence - based policy into policy - based evidence. a€another former government chief scientist, professor sir john beddington, also refused to back the cull. more than 30 scientists signed a letter that was published in the observer on 14 october 2012 and states thata€œthe complexities of tb transmission mean that licensed culling risks increasing cattle tb rather than reducing ita€. the letter ends by saying, a€œculling badgers as planned is very unlikely to contribute to tb eradication. a€"", ""i am disappointed that the minister did not give way at the end. i think it is very unfair to characterise the situation as being the fault of the previous labour government. let us remember that it was the previous labour government who - rather controversially - actually backed the randomised badger cull tests from which the conclusion was drawn that the way to tackle bovine tb was not through a badger cull. i repeat that the body of evidence from the scientists involved in the randomised badger cull tests showed that carrying on with the badger cull could have made matters worse. we have seen over the last five years of this horrific cull, which continues, that, even putting the appalling cruelty to one side, it is simply not working. it is all very well for the minister to get up and say that various peer - reviewed reports have implied that it has worked, but the evidence speaks for itself. how can the minister stand there and say that it has worked when the proportion of tb in cattle herds is virtually the same as at the start of the cull, and when it has even spread to other areas? the government are looking in the wrong direction. i heard what the minister said, but i implore him to go back and look again at pursuing a different route, at the cattle movements, at the fraud that takes place, at biosecurity and at doing proper testing and supporting farmers in doing so, rather than expecting them to stump up for the bill. this is an appalling state of affairs. i repeat that there is no scientific evidence to support the government ' s position. public opinion is overwhelmingly opposed to the badger cull, which does not serve the farming community in any way, shape or form and certainly does not serve the interests of wildlife in our country.""]"

the promoters may not thank me for saying this - it should not be the case that, for example, the commissioners ' mates or one particular group end up finding themselves on the navigation advisory committee. however, the promoters were happy to accept the idea that relevant interests should be declared and that there should be clear processes for how that works."", ""members will be pleased to know that i can be relatively brief. the government support the bill, which is promoted by the middle level commissioners, a statutory corporation constituted under the middle level act 1862. we have had a good debate this evening and i commend the many probing amendments that my hon. friend the member for christchurch ( sir christopher chope ) tabled, but i believe that all the points he raised have been dealt with comprehensively, in particular by my hon. friend the member for torbay ( kevin foster ), who has a deep grasp of all the detail of the bill. the legal framework that governs the commissioners ' navigation function is made up of a number of 18th and 19th century acts, which are now considerably out of date and do not align with modern requirements or the statutory framework that is applicable to other navigation authorities. in particular, the current legal framework that governs the commissioners does not include adequate provision for the registration of vessels using the waterways or the levying of charges for the use of the waterways and associated facilities. as a result, the commissioners do not receive any income from the navigation of the waterways, which has meant that moneys raised through drainage rates and levies have had to be used to fund navigation rather than for flood defence purposes, which is contrary to government policy. the commissioners are therefore seeking to update and clarify their powers to enable them to properly regulate and fund their waterways. the powers that they are seeking are similar to those used by other large inland navigation authorities, for example the canal and river trust, the environment agency and the broads authority. i very much support the bill and hope that it will pass unamended this evening."", ""i am pleased to respond on the opposition ' s behalf to this opposed private business. although it might not be the most conventional way to introduce legislative change, and i have heard the detailed reservations of the hon. member for christchurch ( sir christopher chope ), we are none the less satisfied that the bill makes sense, and our intention is to support the bill as it stands. although the bill is fairly narrow in scope, we acknowledge that it has important consequences for those who will be affected. we are satisfied that due scrutiny has taken place in committee and is taking place at consideration stage this afternoon. the middle level of the fens was first drained in the 17th century to reclaim an area of farmland in cambridgeshire and west norfolk. the middle level commissioners are the navigation authority for the waterways, established through a series of local acts passed between 1663 and 1874, so we appreciate that the legislative framework underpinning the role of the commissioners is in need of an update. this is not least because almost all the fenland within the middle level waterways is below sea level, and if it was not for a complex system of flood mitigation and drainage schemes managed by the commissioners, the waterways could pose a significant risk to the estimated 100, 000 people who live and work in the area. in the simplest terms, the bill will introduce a registration scheme for vessels in the middle level and allow the commissioners to bring in revenue from boat owners that will be used to improve the waterways. the environment agency, the canal and river trust and the broads authority all have similar powers in respect of their own navigations, so in many ways, the bill is long overdue in bringing the middle level into line with its neighbours.""]"

we have got to get it right in our own hospitals and across the nhs and the whole united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland, and then we can look further afield to other countries. he reminds me that last year i had occasion to be in hospital three times for various operations. i never had any infections. i had nothing but the best care. the surgeon ' s knife went in the right direction and removed what had to removed. it was important to do that. the important thing is that we have hospitals and an nhs that are excellent. when the nhs works well, it is the best in the world, but sometimes we need to think about things. the cost of infections to the nhs includes the immediate costs of treating patients in hospital, bed - blocking and so on. there are also issues with hospital capacity, which has reached 100 % in some cases. the world health organisation estimates that 50 % to 70 % of hospital - acquired infections are transmitted by hands, so improving hand hygiene must play a central role in any strategy to reduce hospital infections. it would be remiss of me not to note the work carried out by the secretary of state to improve patient safety in the nhs - let us give credit where credit is due. in november 2016, there was a commitment to halve gram - negative infections by 2020. the secretary of state announced he would appoint a new national infection prevention lead, dr ruth may. both are important steps in bringing down infection rates and show a commitment to do so. given that 50 % to 70 % of hospital infections are transmitted by hands, i was encouraged to see alongside those measures a commitment for the nhs to publish staff hand hygiene indicators for the first time.""]"

it is worth noting at this point that the government have in many ways been very supportive of cornwall in recent times. we are seeing record levels of investment in our transport infrastructure, and cornwall remains the only rural county to have been given a devolution deal by the government. however, when it comes to the specific matter of recognition of the cornish as a people, there is still a great deal to do."", 'i am deeply honoured to be able to make the case tonight for celebrating cornish identity and to call for the inclusion of cornish identity to be recognised in the next census in 2021. i am very grateful for the support of many of my cornish colleagues here in the house this evening. there is no doubt or debate over the fact that the cornish are a proud people who share an extraordinary history that can be traced back thousands of years. in calling for this debate to make the case for a cornish tick box for national identity in the next census, there is a risk that some may see this as some sort of gimmick designed simply to boost our tourist industry or play into a stereotype of cornish country folk. nothing could be further from the truth. although it is true to say that many of us cornish can be guilty of having a playful jibe at the english, especially those from devon - after all they do put their jam and cream on the wrong way round on their scones - this is not a whim or some notion based on a romantic view of the past. the cornish have, along with our welsh cousins, the longest history of any people in britain, dating back 12, 000 years. it is believed that these ancient people entered this isle after the ice age from the area now occupied by the basques. genetic codes indelibly mark the cornish with the dna of their ancient ancestors. it is believed that a staggering 80 % of the cornish retain this genetic marker. the cornish language, which is seeing a revival in recent times, has a 5, 000 - year history. we in cornwall have our own culture and our own ways. cornwall even has its own patron saint, st piran, whose life is celebrated on 5 march every year. we have our own flag and even our own tartan, which i am modelling so well with my tie this evening.', ""i am grateful to my cornish colleague for that intervention and for pointing out the hon. member for wycombe, who in fact attended the same school as me in cornwall, so we have a great deal in common. he makes a very good point. this is not just about people currently living in cornwall ; it is about the right and opportunity for people across the country who count themselves cornish - maybe by birth ; maybe by ancestry - to identify themselves as cornish. the point has been made that there is the option under a€œothera€ in the census to write a€œcornisha€ as one ' s nationality. in fact, in 2011 a staggering 73, 000 cornish men and women chose to do so. i should declare an interest in saying that i was one of those 73, 000 people. an interesting comparison is worth noting. those 73, 000 people represent about 14 % of the residents of cornwall. that is the same percentage of welsh residents who wrote a€œwelsha€ under the a€œothera€ option in the 2001 census. in 2001, the inclusion of a specific tick box for a€œwelsha€ increased the percentage of people identifying as welsh from 14 % to 66 %. i am convinced that if a tick box was provided, we would see a similar increase in the percentage of people choosing cornish as their identity. a dropdown menu provision for a€œothera€ is not good enough. recognition by way of a tick box will not only satisfy those of us in the far west but enhance the accuracy of the census by allowing the many thousands of cornish men and women from across the uk - the cornish diaspora - to know that they can declare their cornish identity. gleaning accurate data is surely what the census is all about.""]"

drawn carriages and submarines should have been covered by the bill - we thank them for that. some of our learned labour colleagues in the other place were more than qualified to speak about this topic, as one is a former airline pilot and another the president of the british airline pilots association. i pay particular tribute to them for their work on this issue, and we thank the government for the technical amendments that they tabled in response to the concessions that we won. i reiterate the point that our colleagues in the other place made about enforcement. we have over 21, 000 fewer police officers compared with in 2010.', 'the bill has been much improved by the persistence of our labour colleagues in the other place. i am sure that the whole house would want to join me in sending condolences to my hon. friend the member for kingston upon hull east ( karl turner ). he had been leading for the opposition on the bill, but he has just lost his father, the distinguished hull city councillor ken turner. our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family today. as no amendments were tabled, i shall highlight a few points in the bill itself. it is a short bill, consisting of two substantive and two procedural clauses. clause 1 makes it an offence to direct or shine a laser beam towards a vehicle or a person in charge of a vehicle in such a way as to dazzle or distract the person driving, piloting, navigating or otherwise in control of the vehicle when it is moving or is ready to move. it results from an amendment tabled by labour colleagues in the other place. there may be mitigating circumstances if it can be proved that the use of the laser was necessary in, for example, a rescue mission to attract attention of a pilot, or that the offence was committed by accident if the laser was being used professionally and all precautions had initially been taken to prevent an incident from occurring. the penalty will be imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. advancing the deterrent sends a clear message that laser misuse will not be tolerated. it has also been clarified that a laser beam could be a pulsed or continuous light, and it is defined in clause 3. the definition of the modes of transport to which the bill will apply has been extended, thanks to the work of my labour colleagues in the other place. the bill is an important piece of health and safety legislation to safeguard those who operate modes of transport from the effect of laser misuse.', 'five years is indeed the maximum sentence and the maximum fine is unlimited. the bill extends to the entire uk and will come into force in england, wales and scotland at the end of the period of two months beginning with the day on which the bill is passed. in northern ireland, aviation and shipping are reserved, and the provisions relating to those will come into force at the same time as in the rest of the uk. the bill is now in a better shape than when it was introduced. in particular, the creation of an offence for shining a laser at air traffic control has received widespread endorsement and is one that the government are happy to support. the bill has been a great example of the important role parliament has in strengthening legislation. i also thank those outside the chamber who have lent their expertise to this important bill. the uk laser working group, chaired by air commodore dai whittingham, the civil aviation authority, nats, the maritime and coastguard agency, the trade union the british airline pilots association, the national police air service and many others have provided invaluable advice on some very technical issues. our work in this area does not stop once the bill is passed. the bill specifically covers the risk posed by shining a laser at a person in control of a vehicle, but, as we discussed on second reading, the government have also announced new measures to tackle the sale of unsafe laser pointers. more than 150 incidents of eye injuries involving laser pointers have been reported since 2013, the vast majority of them involving children. in many of these cases, neither the children nor their parents have known the danger involved. the government will work to raise awareness of the risks associated with laser pointers, including among schoolchildren. in addition, the government have pledged extra support to local authority ports and border teams to stop high - powered laser pointers entering the uk.']"

he is very knowledgeable about these issues. i will come on later to the asks and the potential resolutions. he has absolutely hit the nail on the head - that is exactly what we need. that also involves safeguarding. i hope the minister will respond to that point. that this is a growing issue is evidenced by the growing number of grandparents support groups across the country. one has been recently established in my patch, in worcestershire. the bristol grandparents support group has dealt with more than 6, 000 grandparents in the 11 years since it was formed. unfortunately, one experience that many alienated grandparents have in common is that they have sometimes had a visit from the police. i have heard from a number of grandparents who have tried to send birthday cards or christmas gifts to their grandchildren and found themselves being visited by the police and accused of harassment. as jane jackson of the bristol grandparents support group said : a€œgrandparents are living in fear that if they drop a present at the door, then officers will come and march them to the cellsa€. of course, genuine cases of stalking or harassment are extremely serious and need to be dealt with accordingly, but it seems that our anti - harassment laws are being used as a weapon in family disputes. i hope the minister will tell us how we can overcome that. what can grandparents who have been cut off from their grandchildren do? if appealing directly to the parents ' good will does not work, the first step is to go through mediation. if that does not work, the next step is for grandparents to apply for a child arrangement order. increasing numbers of grandparents are taking that route. ministry of justice stats show that 2, 000 grandparents applied for caos in 2016, up from just over 1, 600 in 2014.""]"

bank businesses after the implementation of this budget. that is a vital point to get across. the hon. gentleman also tried to link funding for children ' s services to the bank levy. in one of my interventions, i gave some figures on the total amount of tax that banks are paying. we can argue about why they are paying that extra tax. clearly, it is at least in part due to the surplus profits rate and to the bank levy. it may also, in part, be due to the fact that the banks ' profits have increased."", ""perhaps we can get into the nitty -

23 is forecast to be a£3. 2 billion. by 2023, as i have said, we will have raised around a£44 billion in additional bank taxes since the 2010 election. opposition members have also suggested that our bank levy is set at a low level compared with other countries. in fact, not all financial centres have a bank levy. the usa, for example, chose not to introduce one at all, and while several eu countries introduced bank levies following the financial crisis, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between these levies as the rules for each are different. we have heard the argument this afternoon that we should reintroduce a tax on bankers ' pay. one of the aims of the changes to bank taxation announced in 2015 and 2016 is to ensure a sustainable long - term basis for taxing banks, based on taxing bank profits and the bank levy. by contrast, the bank payroll tax referred to in new clause 3 was always intended as a one - off tax. reintroducing it would be ineffective and unsustainable compared with the package of banking tax measures that we have introduced. even the last labour chancellor pointed out that it could not be repeated without significant tax avoidance. opposition members also propose that hmrc should publish a register of tax paid by individual banks under the levy. taxpayer confidentiality is rightly a core principle for trust in our tax system and hmrc does not publish details of the amount of tax paid by any individual business.""]"

i have worked in the local extended access service. i have been employed as a gp since my election to parliament, and before that i was chief executive of hartlepool & stockton health, which is a gp federation established by all local gps as a non - profit - making venture to allow collaboration between practices and other parts of the nhs. i resigned my position when i was elected, and i served my notice. my partner, vicky, is a nurse in the local nhs and she derives some income from the gp federation. as the minister will know, the government ' s ambition is for all patients to be able to access evening and weekend gp appointments, which is a good thing. it is difficult for each individual gp practice in any area to open every evening and weekend, but it is achievable if gps work together. in stockton south in april 2017, hartlepool & stockton health started to deliver extended access appointments between 6. 30 pm and 8 pm on weekday evenings, for three hours on a saturday, and for two hours on a sunday. local gps did that as a collective through their federation. the federation was set up as a private company - there is as yet no nhs gp federation organisation that it can belong to - but it was designed as a not - for - profit organisation because local gps insisted on it. they did not want to make any profit out of collaboration."", ""i will continue, if i may. i am genuinely worried that plymouth ' s primary care crisis is going to get worse in the coming days. we know that there are gps who are considering whether to renew or to hand back their gp contract - a decision that will be made in the next couple of days. that is deeply worrying not only for them, but potentially for patients. my gp surgery in plymouth closed recently, so i know what it is like to lose my gp. at the moment i am especially concerned about people who do not reregister with a new gp, effectively becoming an unregistered cohort of people in the city who then can rely only on acute a & e services. our staff at derriford a & e do an absolutely fantastic job, but they cannot keep going if there is a continuing crisis. the plymouth herald reports that a third of gp surgeries are at risk of closure as vacancies in primary care escalate. will the minister meet plymouth gps so that they can raise concerns directly with him? there is an opportunity to avoid the crisis getting any worse through proactive measures. i do not want to see the crisis getting worse and then more emergency access having to be put in place as gps who have worked beyond the point of exhaustion hand back their contracts. that decision can be justified because of the pressure on them and their families, but we can avert that situation if we take action today. i hope the minister will address that in his remarks."", ""i will continue, if i may. apologies. another gp, dr williams, said that the system is failing and it feels as though it might be intentional. gps have heard nhs england say that it is watching plymouth as a place where primary care could fall over, a sentiment that several gps have expressed to me in private. they believe that plymouth ' s city - wide system is facing bigger concerns in primary care than elsewhere. a meeting with the minister is vital, so that he can reassure those gps that the department of health and nhs england are on top of this. another inner - city gp said : a€œi became a gp to help people with physical and emotional health difficulties and this is a job i have really enjoyed for a number of years. during this time patient needs and demand on general practice has increased significantly but unfortunately funding has not kept pace... we only get... a£115 per patient per year to provide the totality of patient care so it ' s no surprise we are struggling when some patients consult us at least once a week. a€the general medical services contract includes between a£73 and a£117 per patient, but as we have seen in plymouth where gp surgeries have fallen over and emergency providers have been brought in, there can be as much as a£347 per patient under emergency access contracts. there seems to be a huge financial gap there that could be moderated by supporting gps - not by giving them more money themselves, but by providing support and assistance so that they can hire more gps, and by supporting the other professions that make for a successful gp practice. worryingly, the doctor i referred to said : a€œi no longer enjoy being an nhs gp because i cannot keep pace with demand and i know our patients are getting frustrated with restricted access to their gp.""]"

they must rely on private investment from owners and the support of local businesses. they need the watchful eye of the english football league to ensure that owners abide by the rules and that clubs are living within their financial means. clubs need the help of their local councils for the use of stadiums, and of course they need the fans as a regular source of income and ongoing appeal. football clubs need to be run as businesses, but if a company cannot guarantee a product, its customers go elsewhere. clubs are not like that. they are built on fan loyalty passed through families and generations ;

what a joy - anita roddick of the body shop, who was a wonderful and remarkable lady, became our patron. she died in 2007. the house may know that she contracted hepatitis c from a blood transfusion in 1971 and was unaware that she was living with the disease until 2004. a routine blood test revealed the diagnosis. she was a tireless campaigner, and we owe her a great debt of gratitude, but since 2007 we have struggled to find a patron to head up the organisation as president. if colleagues have any ideas, i know our appg would be glad to hear from them.', 'of course, the hon. lady states a fact not an opinion, and i accept that, which is why i speak of the importance of primary care and of making every contact count. the people who portmans pharmacy interacts with are not all sick. people who have a hepatitis c infection or a drug -

related murder of our late colleague in the labour party, jo cox, and between march and september 2017, there were a further five terrorist outrages, at westminster, on 22 march, at manchester arena, on 22 may, at london bridge, on 3 june, at finsbury park, on 19 june, and at parsons green, on 15 september - although, mercifully, no one was killed in that final attack. it is fundamental that our approach in legislation does not undermine the very values that the terrorists seek to attack. the rule of law has to be fundamental to our approach. i am grateful for the consensual approach that the security minister has taken on the bill and the concessions he has made. the concession in respect of the three clicks in clause 3 makes it a better bill. the concession on clause 14 and the preservation of the right to peaceful protest is very important, too, and is very much a part of what he rightly said about protecting our own values as an open, liberal and tolerant democracy. i hope that this consensual approach can now continue into the lords. as i indicated in my speech on the first set of new clauses and amendments, i am concerned that the designated areas clause came so late, and we will therefore want to subject it to scrutiny.', 'i come to this debate wanting to be positive about attempts by the government to give our police and security forces the powers that they need in the fight against terrorism and to balance that with the equal priority of ensuring that we do not hit our civil liberties and therefore give the terrorists a victory. already we have heard how different aspects of this bill will be judged by those tests. no one who witnessed the horrors in london and manchester last year can be in any doubt that we need to redouble our efforts to protect the public. the evidence is clear, and the terrorist threat across the uk remains severe. with that threat morphing into a diverse range of threats, including people acting alone, and with the numbers involved increasing, if anything, the terrorist threat for our security forces and the police is probably the most difficult it has ever been. liberal democrats will not, at this early stage, seek to oppose this bill, but ministers and those watching this debate should not take that as agreement, in full or in part, to these proposed laws. we need to scrutinise the bill to make sure that we get the balance right. it is already clear from this debate that there are serious questions whether some of these proposed laws are necessary, whether they are properly based on sound evidence and whether there are sufficient safeguards to prevent their being abused against totally innocent citizens. the government may have a job in persuading this house and the other place that these measures should pass totally unamended in the form that we see them tonight. in considering yet another piece of terrorism legislation, the house should recall the opinion of the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, max hill, when he was appointed just over a year ago. he said that he thought that the uk had sufficient offences in the fight against terrorism and that we did not need any more.']"

i am sure that the hon. gentleman will agree with me on this - there was a long, but really insightful lecture by the daughter of the celebrated rabbi gottlieb of glasgow. such was his reputation among all glaswegians of the jewish faith and of none that a civic function was put on by the city ' s lord provost when the rabbi left glasgow for israel. it is worth reflecting on the history of the jewish community in scotland. scotland is the only country in the world that has never had an anti - semitic text on the statute book. indeed, the declaration of arbroath, which is often sung by those of us on these benches and is one of the oldest surviving medieval texts in existence, specifically refers to jews and gentiles as equal citizens. glasgow ' s jewish community - and scotland ' s - have been a precious part of our history, and they deserve to be a precious part of our future as well, because they are a people who have been hunted to the four corners of the world for centuries.""]"

based system to a responsible body, the potential exists, however small that potential may be, for an unscrupulous person who is not necessarily working in the best interest of an individual to exercise that power simply to maintain a business model in their own facility or care home. such cases may be few and far between, but we have seen many situations across the country where one or two individuals have taken advantage of people in vulnerable situations, and i am not convinced that the bill, as currently written, goes far enough to provide safeguards. the minister shakes her head, and it would be wonderful if she could address that in her summing up."", ""i speak as a member of the joint committee on human rights. we looked at this whole issue generally in our report in june, and we looked more specifically at the bill in october, so i declare that interest. article 5 of the european convention on human rights sets out the right to liberty and security. it says that no one shall be deprived of their libertya€œsave... in accordance with a procedure determined by lawa€. that essential safeguard applies to all those who are deprived of their liberty, not just people in the criminal justice system, and so it should. the previous system involved the deprivation of liberty safeguards, which were criticised by the house of lords committee on the mental capacity act 2005. the committee found thata€œfar from being used to protect individuals and their rights, they are sometimes used to oppress individuals, and to force upon them decisions made by others without reference to the wishes and feelings of the person concerned. a€so reform is most definitely needed. the only guidance that the mental capacity act 2005 gives to the courts is thata€œreferences to deprivation of a person ' s liberty have the same meaning as in article 5 ( 1 ) of the human rights convention. a€the supreme court, as has been mentioned, has defined deprivation of liberty in an a€œacid testa€ that covers all those who are under a€œcontinuous supervision and controla€ and a€œnot free to leavea€, regardless of their condition or contentment. it was logical of the supreme court to do that, but it has none the less meant that hundreds of thousands of people who were not previously considered as being deprived of their liberty may now be so considered, and 125, 630 people have been unlawfully deprived of their liberty between 2017 and 2018."", ""i beg to move an amendment, to leave out from a€œthata€ to the end of the question and add : a€œthis house declines to give a second reading to the mental capacity ( amendment ) bill, notwithstanding the need for reform to the current system of mental capacity assessments and while acknowledging the improvements made to the bill by the house of lords, because the bill underwent no pre - legislative scrutiny, it does not put the interests of the cared - for person at the heart of the bill, it enshrines a conflict of interest in relation to independent providers of health and care services, it fails to provide measures to reduce the substantial backlog of deprivation of liberty safeguards assessments and it fails to recognise explicitly the interface with the mental health act when determining which legislation should be used to authorise care or treatment arrangements. a€the issue before the house today is one of fundamental importance to us all : the individual liberty of vulnerable people. today, we are being asked under which conditions it is right to deprive vulnerable people of that liberty when they need care and treatment and cannot give their consent, and what protections should be in place when their liberty is taken away. the proposals in the bill to replace deprivation of liberty safeguards have the scope to affect the rights of a large portion of the 2 million people in the uk thought to lack capacity to make their own decisions. among them are people with dementia, learning disabilities, autism and brain injuries. whether to deprive some of the most vulnerable people in this country of their liberty should be an issue that we treat with the utmost respect, thought and care. however, i am afraid the government ' s approach to this immensely important issue has shown few of those qualities.""]"

party support then, and i am confident that we can continue to work together on these important reforms in that way. since the passage of that act, we have engaged thoroughly with a wide range of organisations. ian bauckham cbe has been supporting the department. with 33 years as a teacher and 13 as a headteacher, ian has considerable experience in the education system. i thank him for his invaluable support and his advice to me and my predecessor. between november 2017 and march 2018, ian led wide - ranging stakeholder engagement with groups representing teachers, subject specialists, parents, religious bodies, mps and others. in addition, the department launched a call for evidence to seek public views from adults and young people. more than 23, 000 people responded, and the level of consensus has been encouraging. i am pleased today to be able to announce the key decisions and to launch a consultation on the detail of the regulations and guidance."", 'i beg to move, that this house has considered the matter of statutory personal, health, social and economic education. in march 2017 the then secretary of state for education, the right hon. member for putney ( justine greening ), announced her intention of putting relationships and sex education on a statutory footing, and of creating a power to make pshe statutory in future, following further work and consultation. the children and social work act 2017 provides for it to be made statutory in all schools in england through regulations. a call for evidence is running from december 2017 up to this month. i welcome that call for evidence, which gives us a chance to explore what world - class pshe looks like, going forward into the 2020s. i hope that this debate will be a useful part of that process. pshe in this country has suffered on several fronts. it has been caught up in sterile debates about the difference between knowledge and skills, and about school freedom. it has also become a battleground because of its status as the home of sex and relationships education. it has been incorrectly associated with generic and sometimes obscure pet subjects - even origami. often, we have lost sight of the fact that pshe at its best supports the development of skills and attributes such as managing risk and taking responsibility, and the honing of critical skills that set young people up to succeed in other areas of the curriculum and in their wider lives. surely that is what education is about. despite some of the cartoon battles that i have mentioned, there is a fair level of consensus about what pshe includes : the knowledge and skills that young people need to stay safe -

academy trusts, dioceses and education unions, to help them to do so. all schools will be required to teach the new subjects from september 2020, which is in line with the department ' s approach that any significant changes to the curriculum have a year ' s lead - in time. that will enable us to learn lessons from early - adopter schools and to share good practice further across the sector. we will be seeking views through the consultation to test the right focus for a school support package as we know that it is crucial for schools and teachers to be confident and well prepared. our proposals are an historic step in education that will help to equip children and young people with the knowledge and support that they need to form healthy relationships, lead healthy lives, and be safe and happy in modern britain. i commend the statement to the house.""]"

run housing association in the city. it has improved the quality of life for many glaswegians over the years. michael epitomised all that was good about the labour movement and the opportunity that it has afforded for the advancement of working - class people over the last century. he inspired many local young people into a vocation in politics. i have been particularly moved by the number of constituents who have contacted me in the past couple of days to express their gratitude for the help that michael provided to their family or to their neighbours. to this day, on every single street in my constituency, michael is fondly remembered, even though he never sought any great recognition for his efforts. he often referred to the lesson in the gospel of st luke about jesus healing 10 lepers, but only one coming back to thank him. michael sought to help people humbly, quietly and without any need for praise.', ""on behalf of her majesty ' s government, i join you, mr speaker, in expressing our sadness at the death on sunday of the former house of commons speaker, michael martin - latterly, lord martin of springburn. as we remember his life and contribution to this place today, the thoughts and prayers of the whole house will be with his family and friends. first elected to the house of commons for the seat of glasgow, springburn in 1979, michael martin was dedicated to the people of glasgow. he was a proud scotsman who never forgot his roots, and some members, including my right hon. friend the secretary of state for scotland, experienced his bagpipes playing at his annual burns night supper, which i gather was something of a special event. he demonstrated that pride during his time as a back - bench member, during his spell as parliamentary private secretary to denis healey between 1981 and 1983 and, of course, during his time as a cross - bench peer in the other place. as a back - bench member, in addition to representing his constituents in glasgow, michael martin was a member of the trade and industry committee between 1983 and 1987. in 1987 he became first deputy chairman of ways and means, and he was elected to the position of speaker in october 2000. in the debate before his election, he said : a€œmy apprenticeship has been one of serving the house as a chairman of standing committees, the administration committee and the scottish grand committee. i have never sought to be a whip, a front - bench spokesman or a minister... i have enjoyed defending the rights of the house. a€ - michael martin served as speaker for almost nine years. he was introduced to the house of lords in august 2009, where he was an active cross - bench peer."", ""on behalf of the opposition, i thank you, mr speaker, for your kind words, and the leader of the house for hers, in leading the tributes to lord martin of springburn. like her, i was not a member when he was the speaker of the house. every speaker has their own style and is a speaker of their time, and he had to contend with some challenges. but we can remember the fact that he left school without qualifications at 15, and from a poverty - stricken background he ended up as the first catholic speaker, in one of the most senior posts in public life. michael martin worked as a sheet metal worker at rolls royce, and then as a full - time organiser for the national union of public employees - nupe. there he met another union organiser who ended up as leader of the opposition. he entered parliament in 1979 for glasgow, springburn and then for glasgow north east, serving this place for 30 years. he was a member of numerous committees and he clearly knew how this place worked. when elected speaker, he sat in the chair without tights - as you said, mr speaker - a practice for speakers he abolished. he started his tenure by holding a press conference - a very progressive move. he also served in the other place from 2009 - nearly 40 years of public service. you mentioned michael ' s kindness : a member told me how anyone from a working - class background was always shown support so that they did not feel out of place in parliament. a member of staff, who was also from a glasgow housing estate, told me how michael wrote to her mother saying how proud she should be of her daughter ' s contribution in parliament. to michael ' s wife mary, his son paul, his daughter mary ann and his family, we send our condolences at this difficult time.""]"

as i said, passenger journeys have increased by 42 % on competitive lines, compared with 27 % on those that have no competition ; revenue has increased by 57 %, compared with 48 % ; and average fares have increased by only 11 %, compared with 17 %. the east coast main line has open access operators such as grand central trains and hull trains. other rail lines around the country would do well to replicate that model. open access operators take no support from the taxpayer. the open access model creates competition on the line, which has led to fantastic results. in fact, since that has been the case on the east coast, the main line has had the highest satisfaction ratings in the country. the east coast open access operators deliver the very highest rates : in 2015 first hull trains and grand central each had a 94 % passenger satisfaction rate, which was the joint highest score of all operators. that was confirmed in 2016 and 2017 in the passenger satisfaction surveys conducted by the competition and markets authority. in 2016, the cma recommended more on - track competition generally, either with much more open access to compete with franchises on the same lines or with multiple operators to provide services in a fully commercial environment. unlike the cma, however, the government are yet formally to declare their support for the principle of extended open access. perhaps the minister will take up the offer to do so this afternoon. open access competition has led to new routes being opened or reopened. without open access on the east coast main line, would places such as sunderland, hartlepool, halifax and bradford have the frequent, direct and high - speed long - distance services from which they now benefit? something similar desperately needs to be replicated in northern lincolnshire.']"

why not move hydrofluoric acid into part 2 as a regulated poison? it is highly dangerous : as i said in the debate before christmas, exposure on just 2 % of the skin can kill.', 'this has been a wide - ranging and, on the whole, thoughtful debate. there is agreement across the house on the broad themes of the bill : the prohibition of the sale of corrosive substances to under - 18s and the prohibition of the dispatch of bladed products and corrosive substances to residential addresses. i think it right that the government are tackling the issue of online sales, and, more generally, the sale and possession of acid and knives. we want to ensure that death stars and zombie knives, which have no purpose other than to cause harm, are no longer a problem on our streets. i counted no fewer than 20 back - bench speeches today. i pay particular tribute to the speech of my hon. friend the member for west ham ( lyn brown ), who focused on corrosive substances and referred to the 85 attacks that had taken place in newham. she rightly drew attention to the physical and emotional impact of such attacks on victims. she spoke with her usual knowledge and passion, and i pay tribute to her for her sustained campaigning on this issue. i also pay tribute to my right hon. friend the member for east ham ( stephen timms ) for his speech. he focused on corrosive substances, and brought his technical knowledge to bear on his analysis of the bill and set out a number of useful suggestions that i hope will be taken into account as the bill moves into committee, not least the fact that the home office does not collect national statistics on acid attacks, and it would be very useful if it chose to do so. it is important - my hon. friend the member for sheffield, heeley ( louise haigh ) the shadow policing minister made this point in her opening remarks - to review the list of substances that require a licence for purchase, because that will surely evolve in the months and years to come. my right hon.', 'today i am going to address the corrosive substances provisions of the bill and welcome the progress that has been made. had i realised the direction that the debate was going to take, i would have sought to speak for longer and to discuss the wider concerns that have been raised today. i have been seeking a westminster hall debate on those wider issues, and if any other members wanted to join me in trying to secure a debate in the dying days of this term, i would be delighted. last year, there were 85 attacks using corrosive substances in newham and 468 in the whole of london. in the five years since the start of 2012, the number of acid attacks in london has increased by some 600 %, and my constituency is something of a hotspot. this time last year, the fear in my constituency about acid attacks was palpable. i heard about constituents of all ages and backgrounds who were afraid to leave their homes because the perception was that these acid attacks were random. it was a crisis, and it needed a strong response from government. i called for that, as did my right hon. friend the member for east ham ( stephen timms ), and i am happy to see that many of the specific measures i called for are in the bill. most importantly, the bill takes a step forward in recognising that corrosives are just as dangerous as knives. they can do just as much harm physically and emotionally, so they should receive the same kind of legal and police response. the introduction of a clear and specific offence of possession of a corrosive substance in public should make the job of the police and the courts easier in catching and prosecuting those who carry acid as a weapon. the ban on the sale of corrosive products to children is also very welcome.']"

year - old son, who was killed by a 2 - tonne trailer. since the bill was introduced in the house of lords in february, peers and members from all parties have made thoughtful, informed contributions on the complex issues associated with it. we have heard a lot of arguments on proportionality, on bureaucratic burdens, on cost, on scope and on timeframes, but we have also heard about a number of deaths caused by unsafe trailers. i am particularly grateful to lord bassam, who tabled the initial probing amendment on safety in the context of freddie ' s death, and who pressed the government to do what their impact assessment said they would do and seize the opportunity of this bill to improve safety through better regulation. i also pay tribute to lord tunnicliffe for tabling the amendment on report requiring the government to collate comprehensive data on trailer safety and to publish it in a report, for which the noble lords voted. there has been significant discussion and consensus on the gaps and problems in existing information on light trailers and on the degree of threat they might pose. i am pleased that the government agreed in committee to produce a report that includes a recommendation on whether compulsory registration or periodic testing of trailers weighing more than 750 kg should be introduced - that is now part of clauses 20 and 21."", ""it is an honour to follow the right hon. member for south holland and the deepings ( mr hayes ). i will try my best to emulate some of what he tried to say. i welcome the opportunity to discuss the merits of trailer registration and to highlight the rationale and importance of clause 13 ( 3 ), ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) and clause 14 ( 3 ) and ( 4 ), as amended in the house of lords, and i am grateful to the secretary of state for his earlier comments. the subsections require the secretary of state to collate comprehensive data on the number and nature of trailer - related road accidents in the uk, and to include those findings in a report. i welcome that, because the department for transport ' s current reporting methods do not give us a true picture of the risks posed by light trailers in this country. the subsections also give the secretary of state the power to introduce compulsory trailer registration and mandatory testing of trailers weighing more than 750 kg. i accept that as a long overdue step towards improving trailer safety - although it is a compromise - but my work on the issue over the past three years has drawn me to the overwhelming conclusion there ought to be a compulsory register of all trailers weighing less than 3. 5 tonnes, and that they should be subject to regular testing. i shall say more about that later. my interest in trailer safety began soon after i was elected to this place in 2015, when my constituents donna and scott hussey came to see me about their son, freddie, who had been tragically killed in january 2014. three - year - old freddie and his mum were walking along the pavement when a two - tonne trailer came loose from a land rover, sped straight towards freddie, and killed him."", ""i rise to get more clarity and commitments from the minister, specifically on road safety and reducing loss of life. it will come as no surprise to the minister that i will focus on towbar failure and substandard trailers. on the compulsory registration of trailers, i remain concerned that a non - commercial trailer weighing between 750 kg and 3. 5 tonnes can be on the road without being subject to routine safety checks. given that vehicles over 3. 5 tonnes are regularly tested, it seems logical for trailers that are, say, 3. 4 tonnes, or even 1 tonne, to be subject to regular checks. accidents with trailers of such a size could easily cause serious injury or death, as we have heard throughout the bill ' s passage. provision for regular testing would help to shape the behaviour of road users, giving them greater responsibility for the maintenance of their vehicles. some very heavy trailers, perhaps even weighing 3. 4 tonnes, sit off - road without maintenance, potentially for months or years, before being taken on a road or motorway without any formal scrutiny. that presents a potentially deadly risk to road users and pedestrians. the minister has spoken about the opportunity the bill presents for raising public awareness of safety issues. can he provide any detail of his thoughts on what an education and public awareness campaign might look like? i welcome the commitment he has given to extend testing for all trailers over 750 kg if recommended by the report provided for under clause 20, but that does not go far enough. we have an opportunity with the bill to ensure that all trailers over 750 kg are registered on a compulsory basis. such an intervention would help to prevent serious accidents and deaths on our roads. regular checks would increase the likelihood of a culture change, leading to owners of heavy trailers taking more responsibility for the safety and roadworthiness of their vehicles.""]"

trade in services is broadly in balance. romania is the 18th largest market in the eu for uk exports, and the 19th largest in terms of imports. i can well believe that romania ' s will to continue that trade, in which it has the upper hand, will ensure that a way is found to do that, and that is my hope."", 'i shall come on to the question of the number of people leaving romania and coming to this country in a few moments, but the clear concern in romania is that the young people who leave are not yet returning in any number. they may return in future, and it is true that in certain countries, such as poland, people have started to return and to invest. a number of people who are resident in the uk are investing in romania, but the concern in romania is still about the huge numbers who are leaving and, at the moment, not returning, which puts a great strain on the country. romanians are also concerned about the trafficking of romanian women and children through the european union, including the uk. people are being trafficked for the sex trade and other illicit purposes, such as the drugs trade. clearly that is of concern to the ministry for romanians abroad, and it is one of those areas that we as a parliament need to examine, to ensure that people who come here have chosen to do so of their own free will and accord to contribute directly to our economy, as so many do. equally, tourism and trade provide both a challenge and opportunity. such opportunities will grow dramatically over the next few years. indeed, the deputy prime minister of romania, whom we met on our trip, is married to a british businessman - who i happened to see last week when he was over here. they have been married for a long time. there are also clearly strong economic bilateral relations, all demonstrating the strength of support for the united kingdom and romania. one or two aspects of modern romania and what is happening there are probably not widely known. we visited a number of jewish sites in bucharest. one synagogue is being turned into a holocaust museum, to commemorate and recall the tragic events in romania during the nazi era.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered uk - romanian relations. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, mr betts. i declare an interest, as i am the chairman of the all - party group for romania. i welcome colleagues who were involved in a recent all - party group visit to romania, and those who went there a couple of years ago under the auspices of the inter - parliamentary union. before i talk about the current situation, it is pertinent to review the relationship between our two great countries, which has existed for more than 100 years. our diplomatic relations with romania were established on 20 february 1880, but there was a considerable period, particularly during the second world war and the cold war, when relations were not as friendly as they currently are, so 1990 is considered to be the start of the modern uk - romania relationship. our relationship has grown stronger and stronger over the past 28 years. the united kingdom was a firm supporter of romania ' s joining nato - i will say a bit more about that later - and the european union, and we championed its calls to join both organisations. the strategic partnership that we currently enjoy was established in 2003. last summer, british troops undertook key exercises with romania and other nato allies in the black sea region and the east of romania. our excellent ambassador, paul brummell, noted that it was the busiest period of activity in our bilateral defence engagement in recent memory. that demonstrates our shared history of defence and economic co - operation. our relationship is not limited to our diplomatic or economic relations. prince charles has a sprawling estate in transylvania and visits romania regularly - at least once a year. this year ' s visit coincided with our visit to romania, and many of the key people met him and went to see his estate.""]"

they are a message to the minister to reconsider renewing the dubs amendment, which brought syrian children here. i welcome the observations on china. last month, save the children published the report, a€œthe war on childrena€ at the munich security conference. the report shows that more than 350 million children around the world are living in conflict zones. let us pause for a minute : that is one in every six children on earth, and an increase of 75 % since the 1990s. those are harrowing figures. the images i asked hon. members to remember at the beginning of the debate are only three of those. the report found that nearly half of those children are in areas affected by high - intensity conflict, where they could be vulnerable to the un ' s six grave violations, which are killing and maiming, recruitment and use of children, sexual violence, abduction, attacks on schools and hospitals and - last, but certainly not least - the denial of humanitarian assistance. as i touched on at the beginning of my speech, the shocking increase in the number of children growing up in areas affected by conflict has been fuelled primarily by a growing disregard for the rules of war and indiscriminate violence in countries such as syria, south sudan, yemen, afghanistan and myanmar. furthermore, the increasingly destructive nature of modern armed conflict intensifies the trauma that children experience, and usually leads to long - term mental health disorders such as post - traumatic stress disorder and severe depression. the psychological impact of living in conflict zones can lead to a vicious cycle of conflict, in which the next generation struggles to rebuild peaceful societies following the trauma of violence.""]"

as i acknowledged, there is no doubt whatsoever that some cheating took place, which is clearly serious - but we must distinguish, and allow students to distinguish, between those who committed genuine wrongdoing and who deserve to be punished, and those who have been caught up in a scandal not of their making. that is the distinction i wish to draw in the debate, which the home office has failed to do. in the vast majority of cases, students were told that they had no right to appeal in the uk and that they should leave the country. the experiences of students whose test results were deemed invalid by ets varied considerably depending on when the home office took action and where those students were at the time. the hideous complexity i have alluded to is thrown into sharp relief by an excellent briefing by the national union of students, with the support of bindmans. in some cases, it appears that the home office directed further and higher education institutions to withdraw students from their course of study and told students that they had 60 days to find a new sponsoring institution or to leave the country. of course, having effectively been blacklisted by ets and the government, they invariably failed to do so. by handling cases in this way, the home office placed students outside the usual immigration processes without the right to appeal either in country or out of country. that approach was found to be unlawful by the upper tribunal in the case of mohibullah. the minister should tell the house how many students fell into that category and what steps the home office has taken in light of the judgment in that case to contact other students who were similarly mistreated and, most importantly, to reassure the house that such an attempt to circumvent properly agreed immigration processes will never happen again.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered toeic visa cancellations. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr bailey. i place on record my enormous thanks to my right hon. friend the member for east ham ( stephen timms ), who has put in a huge amount of hard work, not least in helping us to secure the debate. if he were not attending the offensive weapons bill committee, which unfortunately clashes, he would have been with us for the duration. we are here to discuss britain ' s forgotten immigration scandal, which has seen thousands of international students wrongly deported and tens of thousands more left in limbo. their lives have been plunged into chaos by a government who have effectively branded them all cheats, defied the principles of natural justice and created a hostile environment for international students. in 2014, bbc ' s a€œpanoramaa€ uncovered evidence of widespread cheating at testing centres delivering the test of english for international communication - the toeic - on behalf of the home office for non - european economic area students as part of the tier 4 visa. it discovered that, in some colleges, exam invigilators read the correct answers to students or supplied proxies to sit sections of the test. the provider administering the tests, educational testing service, claimed that 33, 725 people who took the test used a proxy, and it suspected a further 22, 694 instances of fraud. that abuse on such a scale was allowed to take place at a home office - approved provider was clearly a source of political embarrassment for the government and the home secretary of the day, who is now our prime minister. when immigration system abuse goes unchecked and unchallenged, it undermines public confidence in the system and the government responsible for it."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr bailey. i thank my hon. friend the member for ilford north ( wes streeting ) for opening the debate in such a powerful and forceful manner. i also thank all other members who contributed. the situation of toeic students has a long history. the original controversy came to light in 2014, when bbc ' s a€œpanoramaa€ uncovered an unacceptable situation of bogus colleges and fake tests through which people were illegitimately gaining uk visas. there was a crackdown, and the government revoked or curtailed the visas of thousands of students. we have now reached a point where the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. thousands of innocent students have been victims of the crackdown. a prolonged and unnecessarily hostile legal fight with the home office has taken years to reach a settlement. the effect on innocent people caught up in the toeic scandal has been catastrophic and constitutes a grave injustice. the government have not confirmed the numbers, but i have seen estimates that between 4, 000 and 7, 000 students have been falsely accused of faking their tests and deported. four years after the scandal, many students still have no resolution to their cases. for many, their mere presence in the uk was made unlawful. they have been subject to the hostile environment, stripped of the right to study, to work, to find accommodation and to access banking and nhs services. because the charge is of having engaged in fraud, many students have felt compelled to stay in the uk to clear their names. they are unlikely to obtain entry clearance in the future without removing the charge from their record. in 2016, the home affairs committee heard from a witness who clearly said that they did not cheat on their english language test.""]"

they also have a positive impact on increasing economic productivity. widespread access to vaccines in developing countries offers many benefits, including direct medical savings by preventing illness, and also through indirect economic benefits such as educational attainment, labour productivity, cognitive development, higher income, savings, and of course investment. i could go on. to put it simply, healthy children are more likely to attend schools and become economically productive adults. vaccinating a baby benefits everyone in the long run. as all of us in the chamber will note, we have all been through the vaccination process and are of course eternally grateful for it. a harvard university study published in february in the journal health affairs modelled the health and economic impact of vaccines for 10 diseases in 41 developing countries. it showed that increasing vaccination rates in developing countries could reduce poverty."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr evans. i thank my right hon. friend the member for preseli pembrokeshire ( stephen crabb ) for securing this important debate. we must not underestimate the value of human capital to the future of developing countries. around the world, year on year, countries are still losing the talent and potential of countless people, including children, whose lives are tragically cut short by vaccine - preventable diseases. the vaccines for these diseases exist : if we want those countries to reach their fullest economic potential, ensuring people there have access to vaccination must be one of our highest priorities. vaccines are vital in every sense of the word. they ensure that as many people as possible - children and adults - live and enjoy healthier lives throughout the world. healthier people are more able to go to school and work, and to drive the growth of their countries ' economies, intellectually or physically. the logic and the evidence are clear : vaccines are a powerful force for economic development and wealth creation. a recent harvard study projected that vaccines will prevent 36 million deaths by 2030 and prevent a further 24 million people across 41 developing countries from sliding into poverty. those are staggering and extraordinary figures. they show why it is so important that vaccination is at the top of the uk government ' s agenda for international development. we must not fall into the trap of thinking that health and economy are separate ; in my view, they are inextricably linked. as the harvard evidence shows, a healthy society can evolve to become a wealthy society. i am delighted that uk governments of various colours in the past decades have recognised the value of vaccines. in 2016, the government invested a£116 million of bilateral aid towards vaccination in developing countries.""]"

joint enterprise has been applied in cases for more than 300 years, although it is a common law that has never been passed by parliament. the doctrine allows for more than one person to be charged for the same offence, despite the fact that they may have played a different role, or no role, in the crime. joint enterprise applies to all crimes, but in recent years it has been particularly used as a way to prosecute murder, especially, but not exclusively, in cases involving groups of young men. this is obviously a very emotive issue, particularly for families of murder victims, and no one is suggesting that those who commit murder, or who knowingly and intentionally assist in committing murder, should not face the full force of the law. however, nor should the evidential bar for serious offences like murder be lower, by virtue of presence or association with the principal offender, as we have all too often seen. indeed, there are many cases, many of which i am sure will come to light today, in which people are serving life sentences when it is clear that they did not commit murder but were found guilty under the a€œolda€ or a€œwronga€ law of parasitic accessory liability."", ""mr deputy speaker, along with the whole house i welcome you back to the chair. i congratulate the hon. member for manchester central ( lucy powell ) on securing this debate and thank mr speaker and the backbench business committee for granting it. i draw the attention of the house to my outside interests as set out in the register. we are holding this debate today because we know that thousands of people have been prosecuted under joint enterprise over the last decade alone, and we have a profound fear that some of these convictions are unsound. i am deeply conscious that behind each of these crimes lies a victim, usually murdered, with grieving loved ones whose lives have been changed for ever and ruined. my heart goes out to all those and their families who have suffered in that way. but we also know that there is a wealth of evidence that suggests that joint enterprise has both convicted people in error and wholly disproportionately affected those who identify as black, asian and minority ethnic. young people from ethnic communities have been, essentially, hoovered up for peripheral and in some cases even non - existent involvement in serious criminal acts. the supreme court ' s decision in the case of jogee has established that the previous interpretation of the law was wrong and confirmed the abolition of what i am advised lawyers call parasitic accessory liability, to which the hon. lady referred. but to date only a very limited number of joint enterprise convictions have been quashed. to find a defendant guilty of a criminal offence, a jury must be satisfied that a defendant both committed the crime and had the requisite state of mind to carry out the crime. yet the law on joint enterprise, and secondary liability more generally, was developed by the courts to ensure that all participants in a criminal enterprise could be held accountable. indeed, it has been a key tool when prosecuting suspected gang members."", 'i beg to move, that this house notes the supreme court judgment in the case of jogee and ruddock of february 2016 that the law on joint enterprise and parasitic accessory liability had been wrongly interpreted for more than 30 years ; further notes that since that judgment, the number of cases brought under joint enterprise has remained unchanged ; further notes that there have yet to be any successful appeals of cases from before february 2016 ; and calls on the government to review the use of joint enterprise and to bring forward legislative proposals to clarify the law on joint enterprise. i welcome you back to your place in the chair, mr deputy speaker, and i am sure that the whole house will join me in wishing you and your family all the best ; i know that it has been a very difficult few weeks for you. i thank the backbench business committee for accepting the application for this important debate, and i thank the right hon. and hon. members who supported that application, particularly the right hon. member for sutton coldfield ( mr mitchell ), the hon. member for bromley and chislehurst ( robert neill ) and my right hon. friend the member for tottenham ( mr lammy ), all of whom were co - sponsors of the application. i also thank the families and campaigners on joint enterprise, who are known as jengba - joint enterprise : not guilty by association - and many of whom are in the public gallery today. they have never given up in their fight for justice for their loved ones. why are we having this debate now?

recent research by the royal college of psychiatrists showed that mental health services have less money to spend on patient care in real terms than they did in 2012, and more than a quarter of clinical commissioning groups underspent their mental health budgets last year. the government make many claims about the funds that they have pledged to mental health services - as the minister has today - but it is clear that the money is not reaching the frontline. the cqc thinks that reform of mental health legislation on its own will not reduce the rate of detention, and reductions in mental health beds and community services are clearly contributing to the rise in the number of detentions. is it not time to increase funding for mental health, and to ring - fence mental health budgets?""]"

she has started a company called tip tap, a mobile phone app that will allow diners to give their tips directly to the waiter. they can pay the bill to the restaurant, the waiter will get out their app and then they can pay the tip to the waiter directly. that seems an example of a good solution, but i still do not quite understand why restaurant owners and others feel it is a particular hassle to facilitate that process for their workers, who are often the lowest - paid in those businesses - as i say, on average, they earn only around a£7. 71 an hour. this is a simplistic debate ; i think waiters and waitresses should get 100 % of their tips.""]"

i am not in favour of just letting russia in after all its depredations in crimea, ukraine and syria. of course the council of europe is not for sale, but it is not just a question of money. other countries in eastern europe, and particularly turkey, have also been playing games with money. it is not just russia ; a lot of people should be criticised for this issue."", 'i think that it is really important that the council of europe has standards and says that it will not compromise on its principles. i also believe that it is extremely important to continue to talk and discuss with people. i agree absolutely with that, but not with saying, a€œwe will not worry about that, on the basis that we want to keep talking to you. a€ we have to be tough and say, a€œthis is what we believe, a€ but that does not mean it is impossible for us to continue to have dialogue with people even if we do not agree with them. that is what i think about russia. it is astonishing that even in europe - this continent that holds itself up as an example to the rest of the world - there are still examples where we have to defend the principle of freedom of expression. it is astonishing that in some countries in europe journalists have been imprisoned simply for criticising the government of the day. it is hard to believe. when the council of europe was set up in 1949, would those who went to its first meeting believe that we would be here in 2018 and that there would still be people locked up for what they say or write? i do not believe that they would have. the council of europe says to the governments of its member states that they cannot lock people up simply because they criticise a government, however much they disagree with what has been written or said. it is a fundamental principle that people can organise, write and demonstrate peacefully for something they believe in. here again, the council of europe is standing up and demanding that. i do not want to speak for too long, because i know that others want to contribute, but i have a couple of further remarks to make. the challenges that the council of europe has faced and is facing should not hide its achievements.']"

it does not work. powers are being hoarded in edinburgh and not given down to the local authorities, as they should be. productivity is lower than it was in 2010 and the gap between scottish and uk productivity is wider than it was in 2009. scotland has the lowest rate of business growth in the uk and is forced to pay the highest business rates in europe. in addition, the snp broke a major manifesto promise and raised tax on more than 1 million scots earning over a£26, 000, ensuring that scotland ' s wealth creators have less of their wealth to create more through further investment. we talk about powers a lot in this place ; the issue dominates a lot of our debate, but let us be clear. the only power given back was that to vary income tax by 1p, and it was given back to westminster by the snp, having originally been devolved under the scotland act 1998. the conservatives do not give away powers ;

established and well respected independent fiscal bodies, which provide analysis that is respected and accepted across the political spectrum. that allows the politicians to debate the substantive matter, not subjective opinion. establishing an independent system of accountability will hold manifesto commitments to account before an election, making fiscal sustainability a manifesto premium, and negating the opposition ' s ability to garner support through unsustainable spending commitments. in turn, this will allow us, as politicians, to focus our debates on the content and direction of our proposals without having to waste time debating the credibility of the figures. this is not the first time that this proposal has been suggested. in march 2014, robert chote, the chairman of the obr, recommended to the treasury committee in a hearing that opposition party policies should be costed by the obr, in order to improve the quality of public debate. mr chote was confident that it was within the obr ' s capabilities, although not in its current remit, to review party manifestos for a general election, so long as the parties could agree the terms of reference. during that treasury committee hearing, mr chote said that he supporteda€œthe obr having a role in the costing of political parties ' manifestos in the run - up to an electiona€. he said : a€œif parliament wishes us to go down this route then it does offer the prospect of improving the quality of policy development for individual parties and it potentially improves the quality of public debatea€."", ""were the obr to see its remit extended, that would be a matter for parliament. it would be debated extensively within parliament. to finish my point on civil servants, there is an important matter of principle here. civil servants would have to undertake detailed costings and provide data on opposition policies - we should all acknowledge that that would represent a significant constitutional development for the uk. we would have to be willing to do that in the knowledge of its consequences. to answer other points raised in the debate, the obr does, to some extent, look at the effectiveness of policies. for example, it re - costs policies at each fiscal event, and it looks again at tax policies that arose in previous fiscal events at each subsequent budget. it does not evaluate the individual effectiveness of the policy, but evaluates only its fiscal consequences, although the national audit office and the public accounts committee, as well as select committees, have the ability to do that - and do so, very well. the hon. member for oxford east ( anneliese dodds ) raised a point about the obr ' s remit with regard to the environment. the government are interested in how we can ensure that the treasury takes account of climate change and other important factors. one example of our action is commissioning professor dieter helm to carry out an important review for us and to take forward the idea, still in its infancy, of how we as a country could create natural capital accounts. we are very keen to work that through in the coming years. this has been a helpful debate. it is important for parliament to review the obr at this moment. we have conducted two internal reviews in the treasury, both of which concluded that the remit is sufficient."", ""i do. that kind of objective analysis from the obr could help to inform and shape some of our public debate. it could certainly make sure that policy debates in the house are informed by substantive, objective figures that would hopefully have cross - party support. finally, the obr is responsible for scrutinising the government ' s tax and welfare policy costings, which it does at each budget. the government provide draft costings in the run - up to each statement, which are subjected to detailed scrutiny and challenge. the obr also states in each a€œeconomic and fiscal outlooka€ report and in the a€œpolicy costingsa€ document whether it endorses the government ' s published costings as reasonable central estimates and whether it would use them in its forecast. it also gives each costing an uncertainty rating, based on the data underpinning it, the complexity of the modelling involved and the possible behavioural impact of the policy. those five major roles all focus on the uk - wide public finances. however, the government have also asked the obr to forecast the receipts from taxes that they have devolved - or intend to devolve - to the devolved administrations. it is therefore clear that the obr already has an extensive remit, with a great deal of responsibilities, not only to deliver information to the government, but to ensure accuracy so that that information is reliable enough that the government can make acceptable fiscal decisions. on the earlier point about the obr ' s performance, it has forecast, on average, within 0. 3 % accuracy of actual economic growth over the past seven years. while the exact accuracy in any given year has of course varied, the obr has, to its credit, sustained an accurate reporting standard over a significant period of time.""]"

often unknowingly - rely every day. as my right hon. friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster set out yesterday, the word a€œappropriatea€ was chosen carefully to ensure that the government have the discretion called for by this unique situation. the constraints that a test of necessity would impose would prevent the government and the devolved administrations from making the best corrections to ensure that the statute book continues to function properly."", ""the situation is set out in detail in the written ministerial statement that we laid. both houses will have meaningful votes on whether to accept the agreement. it is my expectation that we would not ratify before that primary legislation has gone through. new clause 1 was tabled by the labour front - bench team. it seeks to place limitations on the use of existing and future powers to amend and modify retained eu law. it is absolutely right and necessary for existing domestic powers granted by parliament in other acts and any future delegated powers created after exit day to be able to operate effectively and without inappropriate fetter within uk domestic law after our departure from the eu. this includes parts of our existing domestic law which will become retained eu law after exit day, as well as retained direct eu legislation which will be converted into our domestic statute book. the bill ' s current approach to existing and future delegated powers aims to ensure the successful operation of retained eu law within our domestic statute book beyond the time limits for the bill ' s more limited specific powers. adopting the new clause, on the other hand, would undermine the position of certainty and have several detrimental effects that would risk creating significant confusion in the uk statute book. first, limiting the modification of retained eu law by existing and future delegated powers only to when this is necessarya€œto maintain or enhance rights and protectionsa€could have uncertain consequences. a test of necessity would impose a high burden that may prevent powers from being used in the most appropriate and relevant way if the regulations they create are not deemed truly necessary for the protection of rights. that could mean that existing and future delegated powers would be unable to amend or modify irrelevant or unsuitable parts of the statute book, leading to ossification of parts of retained eu law within uk domestic law and creating confusion and uncertainty."", 'i cannot give way, because i really must press on. we are committed to proper scrutiny and engagement with parliament and the public on our corrections to eu law and future changes. in addition to all the changes we have already made to the bill, there will be a presumption in favour of engagement or consultation where it is proportionate and sensible to do so. of course, departments will consult where there is a statutory duty to do so. departments across whitehall have already undertaken engagement or consultation with stakeholders for active discussions on areas where that has been proportionate and sensible, and that will only increase. most of those who have supported lords amendment 4 are well intentioned, but some must have known that it would have hugely detrimental effects on how we could deliver a functioning statute book ahead of our exit and in the future. instead of protecting the law in the crucial areas of employment, equality, health, consumer standards and environmental protection, it would weaken it. by calling this amendment a€œenhanced protectiona€, some are seeking to hide a great danger. by limiting the changes that delegated powers could make to retained eu law relating to the specified policy areas to only those that are deemed technical, the amendment would fundamentally limit our ability to properly correct deficiencies. that risks dramatically increasing the amount of primary legislation that needs to be enacted ahead of our exit, putting more pressure on this place ahead of brexit. even the changes deemed to be a€œtechnicala€ enough to be achieved through delegated powers would still face a lengthy enhanced scrutiny process, which the lords could force to be as long as the 18 months required for legislative and regulatory reform orders. in other words, our statute book could not be made ready for exit by 29 march 2019.']"

the minister referred to the expectation that, where there is signage, staff would be asked by customers whether there were any products with allergens, but how does he know whether those staff have been properly trained?

pret now says that it will include full ingredient labelling on all products - so they can do this when they want to. must it always take a tragedy to effect meaningful change from this government? has the secretary of state ever put this case across when in meetings with representatives of the sector?

i appreciate that it is early days, following these events, but as we have seen, food labelling is a serious public health matter. to that end, what discussions have defra ministers and officials had with their colleagues in the department of health and social care? we welcome the fact that pret a manger and other retailers such as greggs have said that they will review how they label their food. pret is now saying that it will list all the ingredients, including allergens, in its freshly made products, but we need this to happen right across the board. this is absolutely vital for people with life - threatening food allergies. full ingredients lists should not just be a a€œnice to havea€. for some people, they really are the difference between life and death. food producers, suppliers and retailers have a public health duty to ensure that every food item is properly labelled. tomorrow, we will be discussing the government ' s agriculture bill, which will mean that the environment secretary will be in charge of our nation ' s food production for the first time in decades.""]"

people do it in groups.', 'i agree with the hon. gentleman. i am glad to see him here because we missed him very much in the adjournment debate last night. i was going to send out a search party to see where he had disappeared to. shisha bars are gaining popularity among young people who do not drink alcohol, either by choice or because of their religion. there is clearly some demand for that type of space where no alcohol is served, because the options in many town and cities are pretty limited. if people want to go out, they are obliged to be in a place where alcohol is being sold and drunk, but that is not necessarily appropriate for everyone. there is a balance to be struck between the social good, where people can come together in an environment where there is no alcohol, and the harm from smoking shishas that the hon. gentleman points out. the perception that smoking shisha is cleaner and better than smoking cigarettes is a very dangerous myth, particularly for young people. the hon. member for birmingham, ladywood pointed out that one session on a shisha can be as bad for your health as smoking 100 cigarettes. that is quite stark. that information needs to be out there and well known. if the government did more to promote the public health message, that might be useful for many of our communities. the tobacco is usually fruit flavoured and slightly different from cigarettes, which can offer a false sense of security that it is not as bad for you, but smoking it doubles the risk of lung cancer and respiratory illness. it also contains all the factors that we know are harmful about tobacco and it is addictive. because of the way that shisha is consumed, people take other chemicals into their lungs from the heating and burning process. it can be more harmful than smoking. in scotland, business owners need to be licensed to sell tobacco, including shisha tobacco.']"

ordination of non - governmental organisations. at the moment, britain and london are one of the leading hubs for ngos and aid organisations around the world. those organisations receive a number of substantial grants, from not only the british government but the european union, and they receive them because they have their headquarters or administrative offices in the european union. one thing we must ensure in any leaving of the eu is that we do not disadvantage ngos that have decided to base themselves in britain - very often because the british people have been so generous historically in supporting international development. we not only have oxfam in oxford, of course, but this city - london - is a leader for international development. having a commitment that the government will not only continue to support these ngos from government funds but go and bat for the ngo sector so that these ngos are eligible for eu funds, even if their registered address is in london, will be vital to ensure that they continue their co - ordinated work. i hope that the government will make a commitment on that. on visits with many hon. friends, i have seen how co - ordination on the ground is so important. often, one of the big players - in other words, the eu or the united states agency for international development - takes a co - ordinating role between government donors in countries, and britain has often stepped up to co - ordinate eu efforts.', ""i am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, mr hollobone, particularly as i was not on the speakers list. i thank my hon. friend the member for crewe and nantwich ( laura smith ) for making such a strong case. i welcome my hon. friend the member for newcastle upon tyne central ( chi onwurah ) on the front bench and i welcome the new minister. i hope he enjoys his portfolio for as long as it lasts. i want to make three brief points that it is important to make, as they sometimes do not feature in debates. although we are here in this important debate to escape from brexit, it very much relates to brexit or what might result from it. first, when i have been involved in trying to save companies and looking at how the public sector can get involved in that, i have always been told that we cannot do so because of state aid rules. i have never understood what those state aid rules are. i am sure that there are state aid rules that apply, and that the european court of justice or the european court of arbitration - whichever it is - can eventually adjudicate on whether public money was used properly, but that is at best years down the line. my point is that the argument about state aid rules has always been used to effectively allow national governments - in this case ours - a cop - out, when what they are really saying is, a€œwe don ' t want to help this company or industry, and we now have a wonderful excuse that gives some credibility to our rationale for so doing. a€ it was applied to steel in redcar, and i can cite local cases where it was up to the national government to put their money where their mouth was and where, if they had really wanted to save a company or industry, they could have."", ""i am deeply grateful for those kind words. i am getting stuck into the job by appearing at this debate, but i am here to represent the views of my department as a replacement minister. my hon. friend the member for rochester and strood ( kelly tolhurst ), the minister for small business, consumers and corporate responsibility, sends her profuse apologises that she has been unable to attend. she is representing the department in the debate on the accounts and reports ( amendment ) ( eu exit ) regulations 2018 in committee corridor. i am here in her place to represent the department ' s views. let me start with what state aid rules are and why they exist, what is and is not state aid, and when it is allowed. put simply, state aid is government support or subsidy of an economic operator that gives it an advantage it could not get on the open market and distorts competition in the single market. the eu has tough rules governing the way subsidies can be given, to stop companies from getting an unfair advantage over their competitors and to ensure that countries with deep pockets do not subsidise their companies to the detriment of companies in other member states. however, where there are good policy justifications for state aid - where the benefit from giving aid outweighs the potential harm of a subsidy - the rules enable aid to be given. not all government spending is aid. in fact, less than 1 % of uk government spending meets the technical definition of state aid. the state aid rules are about supporting fair and open competition, and the uk has long been a vocal proponent of them. the rules exist to stop countries from subsidising their industries unfairly, which would put businesses out of business and workers out of work. a second misconception is that state aid rules prevent nationalisation.""]"

term measure which is us acting in the interest of patient safety because, for the next few weeks over the festive period, we are unable to secure gp cover. a€i think most people would understand that, but not if they knew that the gps were working in the room next door. but that is a separate issue. justin went on to suggest that surely ms fisher understood that local constituents would have real concerns, and asked her whether she would be concerned if she lived in the area. she said : a€œi completely understand their concerns, but what i want to reassure the residents of hemel is that if there were to be any permanent change it would be our absolute intention to include people fullya€in that decision. she went on to say thata€œlegally we would be obliged to consult for a permanent change of that nature. a€that press release was issued not before christmas this year but in december 2016. we have had no night provision at all in hemel since then. everybody has to go for urgent treatment to watford a & e. alternatively, they have to dial 111, which is an excellent service, but after they have been triaged they apparently get sent to watford a & e. watford has just come out of special measures, and i praise the work that has been done at the hospital but there is still a lot more to be done.', 'like others across the house, i thank all staff in all four uk systems, who, as the secretary of state has said, have gone above and beyond the call of duty to focus on their patients, and i do not think any debate we have in here is intended to upset or insult any of them. before the hon. member for ludlow ( mr dunne ) perhaps leaves the chamber, i want to thank him for his service as a minister of state for health, whom i often met across the chamber, but i also want to correct a comment he made in answer to my question on monday. he claimed that the number of patients waiting longer than 12 hours in a & e in england was half the level of that in scotland. naturally, i would have expected the minister to know all the stats and what they mean : in england data are only published for the percentage of patients who meet, or do not meet, the four - hour target. there is no publication of data on eight hours or 12 hours. the clock restarts for patients who require admissions, and that is defined as from the decision to admit until they get a bed and is known as trolley waits. so 48, 000 patients waited over four hours on a trolley after their four - hour wait in a & e to get a bed, and the 109 he was referring to had waited over 12 hours on a trolley for a bed after the four or five hours they had waited in a & e. therefore, it was utterly incorrect to compare that with the scottish data, where we have a single clock from when the patient starts right through until they get to where they need to go. i simply want to clarify that while the hon. gentleman is in the chamber.']"

anger at the cancellation announced seconds before the train is due to arrive ; and, for those lucky enough to cram themselves on to a carriage, anger that they are paying so much for the privilege. now, almost eight months on from the timetable debacle, i discover that batley station is ranked in the bottom 15 in the whole nation for performance. over the last six months - bear in mind that batley is a small station - 459 services have been cancelled. less than 10 % of services overall have been on time. barely a week goes by when a constituent does not alert me to yet another failing.', 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, dame cheryl. i congratulate my hon. friend the member for dewsbury ( paula sherriff ) on securing this important and timely debate. it is a pleasure to follow my hon. friend the member for kingston upon hull north ( diana johnson ). nobody here needs reminding how terrible a year this has been for rail passengers in yorkshire and across the north. since the introduction of the timetable changes in may, we have seen what the transport committee rightly called aa€œperiod of intensely inconvenient, costly and, on occasions... potentially dangerous disruption. a€northern rail, which serves bradford on the leeds - bradford, airedale and wharfedale lines, has provided especially poor service. since the new timetable was introduced, an average of 2. 5 % of trains have been cancelled, and 4. 6 % have operated in our region with fewer carriages than planned. on a typical day, about 100 to 200 passengers are left behind at stations in yorkshire. they are stranded and are late for work and critical appointments that they need to get to. unfortunately, despite the criticism that the train operating companies and the department for transport have come under since may, we have still not had a significant improvement in service levels. in fact, the yorkshire post found that rail punctuality is even worse now than it was in the immediate aftermath of the timetabling change. in november, only 62 % of trans pennine express services and 67 % of northern services arrived on time. eight months on from the initial problems, it is shocking that the industry appears not to have got a grip on this issue. passengers in bradford and across yorkshire have experienced almost a year of delays, cancellations and disrupted service. despite that, fares continue to rise above inflation.', 'i agree entirely with my hon. friend. his constituents are very welcome at burley in wharfedale, menston, ilkley and so on. i believe in the critical safety role of the guard. i will move on to talk about boxing day trains. one consequence of the disruption on northern and trans pennine is that they are not fulfilling their promise - it was in the franchise - to run boxing day trains. northern and their franchise were meant to run 60 boxing day trains this year, and trans pennine were meant to have proposals that would be funded by government. there are no boxing day trains in yorkshire, but there are four lines in the south - east of england that will be running boxing day trains. the following football teams have home games in yorkshire : leeds united, sheffield united and barnsley. harrogate are playing against halifax - a big local derby in the lower leagues - and i will be watching guiseley play against bradford park avenue. there is demand for public transport and trains on boxing day. buses now run in leeds, bradford and some other yorkshire cities, whereas they did not a decade ago. some people cannot go home for christmas from london to yorkshire, because they have to be at work on 27 december and they cannot get a train back on boxing day. there are also the issues of the environment and of loneliness - not everyone relishes being at home for 72 hours at a stretch, in some cases on their own. i appeal to the minister : let us have boxing day trains, as in the franchise, on boxing day 2019. i think he can be the man to deliver that. we have not yet heard much of london north eastern railway in this debate. i understand that it has promised to have seven direct trains to london, which were meant to start in may 2019 - previous transport ministers have assured us that they would.']"

the truth is that the headwinds confronting steelmaking at redcar were strong and kept blowing in. the mothballing of the site was announced in 2009, and after ssi reopened it in 2011 it made a loss in every subsequent year of operation. amid the desolation that followed liquidation in october 2015, the government made a promise, which i am proud to say is being honoured. that promise was that a new beginning would be made on this iconic site, underpinned by huge government support to secure and remediate the land, and anchored in private sector - led growth and investment."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the future of the former steelworks site in redcar constituency. it is an honour to serve under your chairmanship, as always, mrs moon. i pay tribute to all colleagues who are here to support this debate. the former steel site in my constituency has huge implications for the entirety of the tees valley, so i am pleased that colleagues from both sides of the house are here to work towards the future of the site. as someone once said, we are all in this together. regionally, locally and nationally, it is vital that everyone does their bit to ensure we build up from the devastation three years ago and get our communities back on their feet. the site is the key to the future of the tees valley economy. i secured this debate to draw attention to the biggest opportunity for new industry and jobs in the uk, and hopefully to send a strong message to investors around the world that the tees valley is open for business and has the government ' s full support behind it. the south tees development corporation site covers almost 4, 500 acres on the south bank of the river tees. it was once the beating heart of industry, with shipyards, blast furnaces and chemical works lining its banks, and employed tens of thousands of people at its peak. on a visit to teesside during the 19th - century boom, william gladstone observed : a€œthis remarkable place, the youngest child of england ' s enterprise, is an infant, but if an infant, an infant hercules. a€those booming, herculean years sadly did not last forever. although the area is still home to many successful businesses, its industrial footprint is significantly reduced and employment opportunities are much fewer.""]"

why are our young girls being traded for sex in what has become a routine way? whether it is from takeaways, taxis or betting shops, it is happening in our streets. by not addressing what went wrong, victims are left feeling that in some sense they were at fault. it ignores what happened and perpetuates the silence. we have to break that silence and say it is okay to talk about this, and that it will not bring shame on oxford, telford or rotherham or on their families.']"

she did a fantastic job in putting across the labour party ' s view. it was bizarre to watch government back benchers tie themselves in knots yesterday in opposing new clause 7, tabled by my hon. friend the member for aberdeen north ( kirsty blackman ), in relation to entrepreneur ' s relief. if the uk government are confident that their policies are effective, they must not be afraid to review them. indeed, reviewing them is all we can do under this bill ;

there is not 100 % confidence yet, and that has to be the target. from my first days as a councillor 25 years ago, what i have always recommended to my constituents is that there is no such thing as a crime that is too minor to report, because a lot of policing is intelligence - based and trend - based. in the policing model that is used in scotland, it may be that a similar incident that is reported five or six times will not get a heavy response, but it will eventually trigger a very significant response of the kind that puts a large police presence into the area very quickly. it would be nice if we could get a blue - light response every time somebody phones the police, but that is simply not realistic. i want to make a few comments on some of the exchanges that i listened to with great interest about the way in which the police service in england and wales is set up, the way it is managed nationally and locally and the way it is funded. with all due respect, it seems to me that it is a complete and utter mess. i am not convinced that people in any part of england or wales understand what they are paying for the police force, why they are paying that amount and not a wee bit more or a wee bit less, what they do if they want to pay a bit more to get a better service, or how they can influence the provision of their service. i cannot understand why people who are sitting in here should take the majority of decisions about how much police funding is needed in lincolnshire, cornwall or lancashire.', ""it is appropriate in a debate on police funding that we reflect on the sacrifice made by officers such as pc keith palmer, on the bravery of nick bailey and on the work of other officers who daily serve to protect our freedoms in scotland and elsewhere. i am grateful to be able to take part in this debate on the tory government ' s cuts to the police budget in england and wales. as an snp mp, i am thankful that scotland has a separate legal system and that, as such, despite the real - terms cuts to the scottish government ' s block grant, the snp has chosen a different path since taking office. while police forces in england and wales have lost over 13 % of their officers since 2007 as a result of uk government cuts, the scottish force has grown by 1, 000 officers in the same period. with recorded crime at a 43 - year low, that is a good result. however, we can never be complacent and we will continue to keep identifying areas of concern to make sure that the public are served better. the situation facing forces in england and wales is reaching a critical point. the tory government ' s failure to support the police adequately has forced local authorities in england to ask local taxpayers to pay more in council tax to fill the funding gap. this financial pressure has led to the metropolitan police issuing a serious warning to the uk government that officer numbers could fall by 27, 500 by 2021, hindering their ability to tackle local crime and to engage in counter - terrorism measures."", ""i will make some progress, but i may come back to the hon. gentleman later. we recognise how important a well - funded police service is to local people. one of our most popular and effective policies was, as i said, recruiting 1, 000 additional police officers. when i knock on doors in inverness, nairn, badenoch and strathspey, people say they are grateful that there are more police visible in their communities these days. that is in stark contrast with the tory government ' s shameful record, which has seen police numbers fall by over 13 % from 2007 to 2017. in reality, that means there are 32 officers per 10, 000 people in scotland, compared with only 21 officers per 10, 000 in england and wales. that is over 50 % more police officers in scotland. the scottish government understand that our police authorities have to be equipped for the demands of the 21st century. however, meeting those demands does not mean abandoning the principle of local policing. i am delighted that the scottish government ' s a€œpolicing 2026a€ strategy sets out a commitment to retaining police numbers and to the value of local policing. it is because of that that the public continue to have confidence in our police forces. the scottish crime and justice survey shows that public confidence in policing is strong, with the majority of people responding to the survey saying that local police are doing an excellent job. indeed, the survey said that people in scotland feel safer than ever before, with 77 % saying they feel safe or very safe in their neighbourhoods after dark - the highest score ever recorded by the survey. it also estimated that overall crime had fallen by a third since 2008 - 09.""]"

it is not just in this country, although some countries are perhaps doing slightly better. one of the ministers i talked to attributed their success in technical education, particularly at levels 4 and 5, largely to embedding maths and english so well in the curriculum. when young people came out of that skills system, it was a given that they had reached a high standard, so they could get on and take the academic or technical route that they wanted. as my right hon. friend rightly said, surrounding all that is this country ' s economic need for a skilled workforce, but it is also about social justice. i did not go to private school and i did not have the networks that my right hon. friend referred to, which many people have. in fact, i entered politics knowing almost nothing and absolutely nobody. i had to make it up on my own, which was fine for me - i chose politics as a second career - but it is not all right for a young person leaving school at whatever age.""]"

it is a matter of enhancing confidence in animal welfare and animal hygiene standards. it is not a matter of having one or the other ; it is about having both. these are serious concerns, so i would welcome reassurances from the minister that they are being addressed, and that measures will be in place in good time before the uk leaves the european union. another, perhaps more long - term challenge that we face in the veterinary profession, and one that has a particular relevance to wales, is our capability to educate and train our own vets. given that welsh agriculture is overwhelmingly constituted of animal husbandry, it beggars belief that we still do not have a centre for people to undertake veterinary training in wales. rather like traveling from north to south wales by train, for somebody to become a vet in wales, they have to go through england first. i am pleased that plans to bring veterinary medicine training to aberystwyth university in ceredigion are being discussed with the royal veterinary college in london. unsurprisingly, i wholeheartedly support that endeavour, and i hope that the agricultural industry and welsh government support the realisation of these ambitious plans. i strongly believe that doing so would ensure a continuous supply of high - quality vets in wales and would also encourage more individuals from areas such as ceredigion to enter the profession.']"

it is a marriage made in hell. i pay tribute to the work of martin lewis in bringing together the money and mental health policy institute, which has shone a torch on the relationship between debt and mental health.', ""i shall speak to amendments 5, 6 and 7. i am incredibly grateful to colleagues on both sides of the house for the constructive negotiations and discussions that have taken place to enable this group of amendments be discussed on the floor of the house this evening. their purpose is to extend the debt respite scheme set out in clauses 7 and 8 to people in receipt of nhs mental health crisis services. i am incredibly grateful to the large number of mps - 81, in fact - on both sides of the house who are supporting the amendments. it has also been a real privilege to work with the money and mental health policy institute, together with colleagues from all parties, to put the amendments together. last year ' s conservative party manifesto contained a commitment to introduce a breathing space. the government have since brought forward this bill and launched a consultation into how a breathing space initiative would work in practice. this included proposals for a possible trigger point for accessing support, with the initial suggestion that a breathing space should be available only to a person seeking regulated debt advice. i very much welcome the spirit of the government ' s breathing space initiative, but i am concerned that it does little to protect the thousands of people in mental health crisis who are too unwell to physically go and seek such debt advice or to pick up the phone to make that call. according to research by the money and mental health policy institute, up to 23, 000 people in england alone struggled with problem debt while they were hospitalised as a result of their mental health last year. those people are likely to be receiving calls, texts and letters from their banks, local authorities and other creditors at a time of acute distress, and they are at risk of falling into further financial difficulty as a result of increased fees and charges -""]"

in february, we published a consultation on a potential ban on third - party sales. third - party sales of puppies are those that are not sold directly by breeders. sales are often linked to so - called puppy farms, which many of us have real concerns about. we know that there are concerns that third - party sales of puppies and kittens can lead to poorer standards of welfare than when puppies and cats are purchased directly from a breeder. we have heard other reports about that during the debate. a ban would mean that puppies and kittens, younger than six months old, could only be sold by the breeder directly or adopted through rescue and rehoming centres. our recently published regulatory triage assessment - a mini impact assessment - on the impact of a proposed ban on third - party sales estimates that 5 % of puppy sales are by third - party sellers, which amounts to 40, 000 puppies per annum. the rspca estimates that some dealers were individually earning over a£2 million annually from the trade, and in many cases those revenues were not declared to hmrc. our view is that the demand for puppies can and should be met by changes to the practices of existing breeders in order to breed more puppies, and by selling directly to the consumer. that will further improve the welfare of puppies. some stakeholders raised concerns that any proposed ban could be circumvented by unscrupulous centres presenting themselves as a legitimate rescue or rehoming centre.""]"

i pay tribute to the government chief whip, who has worked exceptionally hard to try to protect the government, which is particularly difficult, given that in 2013, 530 mps voted for section 40 and only 13 voted against it. that vote was for the courts and crime act 2013, which enshrined in law the low - cost access to justice that lord justice leveson had agreed was necessary. that was first suggested by lord justice leveson and then agreed to almost unanimously by all parties in parliament. however, it was never commenced. successive secretaries of state have refused to commence the cost - shifting provisions that are so necessary for access to justice. section 40 is not about punishing newspapers that do not sign up to impress ; it is about ensuring low - cost access to justice for vulnerable victims of press abuse. the first part of the leveson inquiry uncovered the horrific scale of abuse, which was endemic in the press, and there have been many court cases and convictions since. section 40 ensures that publishers that are members of an independently approved regulator that provides low - cost arbitration do not face expensive court costs. it also ensures that victims of press abuse who have been attacked by publications that are not members of an independently approved regulator can access justice via the courts without having to be extremely wealthy. there are myths about section 40. the first myth is that it would damage the freedom of the press. that is not true. the press recognition panel is independent and was created by royal charter. the charter enshrines press freedom into law. criteria 8 states that any regulatora€œmust take into account the importance of freedom of speech, the interests of the public... the need for journalists to protect confidential sources of information, and the rights of individuals.', ""i had a lot to say about ipso and impress along the lines that my hon. friend has laid out, but i am aware of mr deputy speaker ' s strictures. i have tried to take as many interventions as i can, and page 2 of my remarks will be put down on this green bench very shortly. i move on to the second issue that i wanted to raise : the second amendment sent to us by the other place saying that we should commence section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013. that would not be the right way to proceed, and i am grateful that my right hon. friend the secretary of state made that point so clearly on thursday. many local papers in north devon have written to me on numerous occasions expressing deep concerns about the impact that section 40 would have. i mention just three : the north devon journal, the north devon gazette and the south molton & district news, which is, incidentally, one of the few papers to have signed up to impress, the new press regulator. freedom of the press is absolutely essential in a democracy. let us think carefully about what section 40 says : if a paper not under the auspices of a press recognition panel regulator is sued for defamation, for instance, it has to pay the legal costs of both sides, even if it wins the case. how can that be sensible? we might argue that that is a pretty blunt instrument with the intention of coercing newspapers to sign up to one of the approved regulators, but 90 % of the national press have not done so, so the blunt instrument is clearly not being effective. the biggest danger, however, is that many small, local media companies, such as those in my constituency that i have mentioned, would simply not be able to run a viable business if section 40 were enacted. financially, the court costs would cripple them.""]"
