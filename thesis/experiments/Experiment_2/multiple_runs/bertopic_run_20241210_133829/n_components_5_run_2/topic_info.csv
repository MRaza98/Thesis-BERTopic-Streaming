there are high levels of passenger satisfaction ; there is growing usage of it ; and, yes, there is investment in it. under virgin, many of the trains have been refurbished and, although i appreciate that this is not a direct part of the franchise, king ' s cross station has been transformed in recent years, so the passenger experience is being enhanced. the issue at the heart of this debate is that something went wrong with the revenue projections for the line. that is what we need to scrutinise. it is important to understand the nature of the east coast main line franchise. it has a much larger discretionary element than most other rail franchises, by which i mean that the passengers who use it have many more options for making their journeys. those options are both on the railways, with other train operating companies running services on large parts of the line - at the southern end of the line, hull trains and grand central offer alternatives to the virgin trains, and further north there is trans pennine express and scot rail, meaning that there is a discretionary element to which service passengers use - and, because of the long - distance nature of the network, passengers can choose non - rail alternatives, including flying between edinburgh and glasgow or driving between some of the key towns and cities. that makes it much more difficult for anyone in the public or private sector accurately to forecast revenues over a lengthy period."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr howarth, and i congratulate the hon. member for bolton north east ( sir david crausby ) on securing this important debate and giving us another opportunity to discuss the disruption on northern rail services. the department is focused on ensuring, as rapidly as possible, that the industry restores reliability for passengers to acceptable levels. i assure passengers who have been affected that i share their frustration, and we have heard from hon. members across the house about how their constituents have been affected in a number of completely unacceptable ways. i echo my right hon. friend the secretary of state ' s words of sympathy on monday, as well as the apology that he gave to the house. that mirrored the apologies from the chief executives of northern rail and network rail, as well as from train operators in other parts of the country, for everything that has gone wrong and for all the difficulties that have been caused to people in the north of england and other parts of the country. the new timetable was introduced on 20 may, and as a number of members have acknowledged, this episode has overshadowed what should have been a positive story for our railways and the economy as a whole. the may 2018 timetable change was planned to deliver more services up and down the country as part of the biggest modernisation of the railway since victorian times, taking into account the great growth in passenger numbers in recent years. as we have heard, for northern rail, which is co - managed through the rail north partnership on behalf of transport for the north and the department for transport, that timetable change unfortunately resulted in significant disruption and inconvenience for passengers and the travelling public as a whole. northern ' s new timetable was planned to improve services for passengers across the north, and it was intended to increase services by 1, 300 a week.""]"

80 % of disability - related poverty is because of the additional costs that disabled people face by virtue of their disability, and these have been estimated at a£570 a month on average. the cuts to social security mean that more and more disabled people are becoming isolated in their own home as their mobility vehicles or personal support are taken from them. many are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage. their health conditions have deteriorated and other conditions have developed, including mental health conditions, as they face the relentless stress and anxiety resulting from a social security system that is hostile, unsupportive and even dehumanising. the sanctions regime that has affected over 1 million disabled people since 2010, the work capability assessment and personal independence payment assessment processes are all part of this. quite frankly, it is grotesque that people with progressive conditions such as motor neurone disease have, until last month, been habitually forced through the personal independence payment assessment process.', 'i have lots to get through. i want the hon. member for central ayrshire to reply, and the scottish national party has had a lot to say today. the hon. lady majored fairly heavily on disability benefits in her speech. we are committed to ensuring that more of the money goes to the people who need it most. we have continued to increase benefits for people with disabilities and health conditions, and we will spend a£800 million extra in 2018 - 19 to do that once again. for people in the employment and support allowance support group, that means a£720 more per year than in 2010. for recipients of the monthly rate of disability living allowance, paid to the most disabled children, it is more than a£1, 200 a year more. at the same time, we are determined to break down the barriers to employment faced by disabled people. the hon. lady spoke about the removal of the work - related activity component under esa. the old system, as we all remember, was failing to help disabled people and those with health conditions into work. only one in 100 esa work - related activity group claimants leave the benefit each month. we believe that disabled people and people with health conditions deserve better than that. we believe that the changes, working in tandem with a a£330 million support package over the next four years, will provide the right incentives and support to help new claimants with limited capability for work. taken as a whole, our policies to help people with disabilities to find employment have been making good progress. more than half a million more disabled people are now in work than four years ago, and on a before - housing - costs basis the absolute poverty rate among people living in a family where somebody is disabled is now down to a record low. on the underpayment of esa, the hon.']"

in circumstances in which the money from the proceeds of the sale of a court are put back into the justice system ; in circumstances in which we are spending a£1 billion on our courts reform programme ; and in circumstances in which finances are not unlimited, we do need to ask ourselves where money on the justice system is best spent. it is in that context that the closure of the courts in calderdale took place. the closures of the county and magistrates courts were proposed because they were poorly used. for example, in the financial year before the consultation, the magistrates court had been used for 33 % of its available hours. both the magistrates court and the county court were also grade ii listed buildings and not fit for purpose. the court consultation resulted in a proposal to move the work to bradford, where better facilities were available for those using the courts.""]"

i accept that many people bank differently these days, but i take issue with the speed at which change is being forced through and the damage it is doing to communities along the way. i ask rbs, if it is watching, to think again. its closure programme is affecting the worst - off and most vulnerable in my community and many others, as we have heard today, but rbs will never understand the frustration that customers across scotland and the united kingdom feel at these bank closures. stepps will be a town with no bank at all. that is unacceptable and speaks to the financial isolation and exclusion that can be triggered when these decisions are taken. i mention all that because our small and medium - sized businesses are going to think twice before seeking to borrow from these financial institutions, and we cannot blame them - not when these banks are prioritising themselves and their profits over the communities they should be serving. they are putting profit before people.']"

related risk, and it is good to see that he is carrying that on. i hope that we will be able to tempt him to talk about some of the work he is doing when he speaks later. as we know, breast cancer is the uk ' s most common cancer, with 11, 500 women and 80 men dying from the disease every year. that said, great strides are being made in diagnosis and treatment, leading to survival rates doubling in the past 40 years. one of the key recommendations in the cancer strategy is on early diagnosis, with a target that, by 2020, 95 % of patients will be diagnosed and receive results within four weeks."", 'it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for bosworth ( david tredinnick ), who made an interesting speech. i also thank the hon. member for east kilbride, strathaven and lesmahagow ( dr cameron ) for securing this important debate. we all know someone who has had, or has been affected by, cancer. my family is no exception : both my parents had cancer and my husband lives with cancer every day of his life, and i could talk about cancer forever -

one of the many effects of the housing crisis is the sheer amount of people now forced into the private rented sector. it is for this reason that i am adamant that we must improve conditions for renters. the liberal democrats have fought long for renters ' rights, so i welcome and support this bill. it is vital that we in westminster ensure that tenants ' fees are abolished because of the transient nature of the private rented sector, particularly for young people. however, the housing crisis has also pushed many families into renting and, as we heard earlier, the leading cause of homelessness is the ending of a private rented sector tenancy. while rental costs continue to spiral, people are becoming trapped. they cannot afford their rent, but nor can they afford to move because of the myriad administrative fees. we must ensure that the bill fully ends the practice of tenants ' fees. however, as the bill is currently drafted, there are still loopholes around default fees. the secretary of state ' s amendments go some way towards closing the gap, and ensuring that letting agents and landlords do not introduce new fees under a different name. however, the text of the bill is still too ambiguous, leaving what constitutes a reasonable cost to the discretion of landlords or letting agents. we must also provide local authorities with appropriate funding to enforce the ban. if local authorities have no resources to enforce it, landlords and letting agents will just continue with this unreasonable practice. i urge the secretary of state to listen to the concerns raised today. otherwise he will undermine legislation that could really make a difference to people ' s lives. there is little merit in introducing legislation with obvious loopholes that allow individuals to continue with a practice that we want to stop.""]"

led government, has dramatically reduced the amount of plastic bags in use : by 83 %. about 9 billion fewer plastic bags have been used since the introduction of that simple 5p charge. the government have brought forward a comprehensive 25 -

whenever they are given a choice - of the option with the least amount of packaging, and of plastic - free packaging if possible. many supermarkets have sought to take action. i believe that much of that has been driven by consumer choice and by consumers ' desire to reduce the amount of plastic packaging, and we should welcome that. in september, lidl announced that it would cease to use black plastic packaging on fruit and vegetable products by the end of that month. as we know, recycling black plastic is challenging. morrisons, the fourth - largest uk supermarket chain, announced in april that it will bring back traditional brown paper bags for its fruit and veg aisle as part of a range of measures to cut plastic waste. i am sure many of us read the reports over the weekend that a north london supermarket is the first independent supermarket in the country to introduce plastic - free aisles, and is now calling on others to follow its lead. there are signs that retailers are starting to get the message that consumers want less plastic waste from their food packaging. i encourage all consumers who feel strongly about this matter to continue to drive home that message. i believe that there is a role for the government, but most of the change will come from the consumer. the introduction of the 5p charge for plastic bags shows that the government can nudge people to make the right choices."", ""the reality is that until now, china, turkey, malaysia, indonesia, vietnam and other countries have largely been happy to accept our plastic because they have seen it as a raw material that they can use to generate more products. plastic recycling is technically possible and exists in this country already - it is just that it is not as economical. people have to pay to recycle various sources of plastic rather than getting a benefit from them, although that is changing. we recognise that china has reduced the amount of contamination that it is prepared to accept in plastic - it does not ignore all plastic, but effectively it has closed the market and made it less worth while. i am sure my hon. friend is eagerly awaiting our strategy on resources and waste, which will appear in due course. perhaps more can be revealed at that time. i mentioned the measures in the 25 - year environment plan we published in january, as well as the government ' s commitment to taking action against the problem of single - use plastics waste as part of our wider strategy. we have given a£20 million to the plastics innovation fund, which is co - ordinated by innovate uk and the engineering and physical sciences research council, and which aims to reduce the environmental costs of plastic and litter. i am pleased to say that, in the budget, we announced not only a tax on plastic products that are not at least 30 % recycled, but a further a£20 million of funding : a£10 million extra for r & d and a£10 million to pioneer innovative approaches to boosting recycling and reducing litter. the fund will be made available during the 2019 - 20 financial year. i agree with my hon. friend the member for north cornwall that innovation is vital in supporting developments to tackle plastic waste, so we will continue to explore commercially viable options.""]"

on effect of all these claims is increased insurance premiums, particularly for young people and the elderly. as members across the house will know, for many people, owning a car is not a luxury, but a necessity. that is especially true of those in rural communities, but it does affect all our constituents. that is why we have pledged in our manifesto to tackle these costs. taken together, the whiplash measures proposed by the government could result in savings of around a£1. 1 billion a year. around 85 % of the uk motor and liability insurance market have publicly committed to pass on those savings to consumers.', ""i am sorry, but given the time constraint and the fact that many other members want to speak, i will crack on. during my latter years as a broker, i saw the attitude change. exaggerated claims were often seen as a a€œvictimless crimea€, and as being okay, because the insurance industry would pick up the tab. although the amounts of compensation paid for soft - tissue claims are relatively small, the associated claims - handling costs - including the costs of investigation, processing, lawyers ' fees and medical reports - are disproportionately large. for example, a claim for about a£1, 000 may ultimately cost the insurer two or three times that amount. it is clear that fraudulent claims have a direct impact on the cost of every one of our constituents ' motor insurance premiums. given an average of about 60, 000 vehicles per constituency, there is a considerable cost. according to the association of british insurers, for every pound paid out in compensation, nearly another 50p is then paid to the claimant ' s lawyer in costs. the bill gives us an excellent opportunity to fix the current broken system, a system that is not working for millions of motorists throughout the country. it will bring about long - overdue reforms of personal injury compensation. it will provide a fairer system for claimants, insurance customers and taxpayers by creating a more proportionate compensation system in the case of both whiplash - style claims and claims to which the personal injury discount rate is applied, while ensuring that claimants still receive 100 % compensation. part 1 sets a new fixed tariff for pain, suffering and loss of amenity, and sets a higher financial threshold for lawyers ' recovery of their legal fees from insurers."", 'it is a pleasure to be able to speak in this debate on the second reading of the civil liability bill, which brings forward changes that are of great importance to the insurance industry. i am pleased to hear that there has been significant engagement between industry and government over this essential legislation. ageas insurance, for example, is one of the largest providers in the uk, employing more than 400 people in my constituency, and it has communicated to me its enthusiastic support for these changes, shared by the vast majority of the public. these measures will help to reduce motor insurance premiums for insurance customers by adjusting how the personal injury discount rate is set. alongside this, the introduction of a new tariff will specifically target exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims that have driven up insurance premiums for hard - working households in places such as stoke - on - trent. a new fixed compensation level for whiplash injury will be created, putting provisions in place for the court to uplift the compensation available in exceptional circumstances, compared with a final compensation figure being negotiated by the parties involved, as is currently the case. the compensation culture that has been created, with huge levels of unjustified claims for things like whiplash, saw premiums rise at the fastest rate ever last year. increases of about 10 % a year are totally unmanageable and unaffordable for motorists. these changes must be brought about to reduce the price all motorists are having to pay to compensate unreasonably high levels of claims. clearly, it is important that these savings are passed on to consumers. i am pleased to hear that the abi, which represents 93 % of the motor insurance market, has written to the lord chancellor emphasising its commitment to this.']"

it is a humanitarian catastrophe. since august 2017, nearly 680, 000 rohingya refugees have sought shelter in bangladesh. there have been some suggestions, including by the foreign affairs committee, that the uk failed to see this crisis coming. with respect, i disagree with such a conclusion. let us be clear about what has led to this current situation. the rohingya have suffered persecution in rakhine for decades. such rights as they had have been progressively diminished under successive military governments. they have been victims of systematic violence before, most recently in 2012 and in late 2016. on these more recent occasions, the rohingya fled their homes - some to internally displaced person camps elsewhere in rakhine, and some to other nations over land or sea. the outbreak of vicious hostility during the past six months is therefore only the latest episode in a long - lasting cycle of violence. we have been urging the burmese civilian government to take action to stop the situation deteriorating since they came to power two years ago. what was unprecedented and unforeseen about this most recent violence was its scale and intensity."", ""i congratulate my hon. friend the member for hornsey and wood green ( catherine west ) on securing this very important and timely adjournment debate on burma. over the last year, burma, bangladesh and the rohingya crisis has been a priority area of work for the international development committee. in fact, the minister gave evidence to us yesterday on the rohingya crisis. we also took evidence from save the children, one of the fine non - governmental organisations working on the ground in bangladesh and burma, and from tun khin of the burmese rohingya organisation uk, which is a voice for the rohingya diaspora who live in this country. one thing that has struck me over the last year is the importance of hearing the rohingya voice. there is a lot of discussion about the rohingya by different parts of the united nations and agreements being reached between governments. all that is, of course, essential, but it is vital that the rohingya themselves have a voice in discussions about their own future. our committee has published three reports on this over the past year. my friend the hon. member for sutton and cheam ( paul scully ) is our committee rapporteur on burma, bangladesh and the rohingya. i pay tribute to the work he does for us. we went to bangladesh earlier this year, as many colleagues on both sides of the house have done. we went to cox ' s bazar, and one of the things that is incredibly striking about it is the sheer scale of the place. i went with oxfam to zaatari refugee camp for syrian refugees in jordan, and the population there is around 80, 000. cox ' s bazar is 10 times the size of zaatari. like my hon."", ""it is a pleasure and privilege to follow my hon. friend the member for bethnal green and bow ( rushanara ali ) and the hon. member for st albans ( mrs main ). they make a powerful cross - party team in leading this debate, and in their excellent and ongoing efforts to ensure that the cause of the rohingya remains firmly on our agenda in the house and the public debate. the international development committee has followed closely the ongoing humanitarian crisis - the hon. member for sutton and cheam ( paul scully ) is our rapporteur on the issue - and over the past year we have published three reports relating to burma, bangladesh and the rohingya. the first report, from january, focused on the issues that both hon. members spoke about, including the culmination of decades of marginalisation, persecution and abuse that the rohingya people have faced in burma. we then looked more widely at the work of the uk government in general, and dfid in particular, in bangladesh and burma. like others, the committee visited the rohingya camps in cox ' s bazar, and we heard the voices of the rohingya people and saw the huge challenges of life in the camps for those families. the scale and complexity of this humanitarian crisis is best experienced at first hand if at all possible. we also sought to visit burma and to ask difficult questions about what is happening, but we were refused visas by the burmese government. in our final report, we joined the call, already set out so eloquently today, on the uk government to gather support for the un security council to refer burma to the international criminal court and to apply targeted financial sanctions against identifiable key figures with responsibility for what is happening.""]"

i expect the minister will say, a€œwe have introduced new routes to expand the number of nursing staff. a€ there are nursing degree apprenticeships that few people are taking up, because employers do not have enough cash to release people to study. nursing associates, who were introduced in a supporting role to the registered nurse, should never be a substitute for registered nurses. these efforts have been small and unpredictable. most importantly, they have not addressed the heart of what grows the number of nurses safely and at scale : higher education. this is workforce panicking, not workforce planning. i expect the minister will say, a€œthis government have grown the number of nurses working in hospitals, a€ which is factually true, but distorts the truth that the overall number of nurses has only grown by less than 1 % since 2010. while there are 7 % more nurses in acute settings, there are 6, 500 fewer nurses in the community, 43 % fewer district nurses, a quarter fewer school nurses, nearly 5, 000 fewer mental health nurses and 40 % fewer learning disability nurses.', ""last month my mum celebrated her 95th birthday. like many irish nurses of her age, 75 years ago she travelled to london from ireland to start her career in the very first generation of nhs nurses by qualifying as a state enrolled nurse at warlingham park psychiatric hospital. growing up, i saw at first hand just how vital a dedicated, passionate and happy nurse was for the welfare of the patients. that is why i am incensed when i see the treatment of trainee nurses today. let us be clear. nursing students are exceptional. their courses are complex, their training is tough, and they spend significant amounts of time on clinical placement, working all hours of the day and night. they deserve a tuition and living cost funding model that recognises their extraordinary efforts and the importance of those efforts. england is now the only country in the uk without some form of bursary for the nursing degree. that has crumbled the number of nursing applications and fostered an environment that is utterly unfair to nursing students and completely unsafe for patients. the government promised that reforms would provide up to 10, 000 additional nursing and health professional training places but, since the loss of the bursary, nursing applications in england are down by a third and falling fast. in fact, the 2018 figure was the lowest since nursing courses were first included in the ucas system. nursing must be made an attractive profession for all groups, and restoring the bursary is a fundamental step to achieving that. now is not the time to experiment with funding models for nursing students. one in three nurses is due to retire within the decade. ensuring the long - term recruitment of new nurses must be a government priority. that, of course, is before we take account of the brexit impact : 75 % of nhs trusts have done nothing to prepare for the uk ' s departure from the eu.""]"

people ' s votes are stolen or someone is elected who should not have been elected. earlier this year, the government announced that they would be conducting pilots for voter identification at the local elections in may this year in line with our manifesto commitment to legislate to ensure that a form of id must be presented before voting. voter id is part of the government ' s commitment to improve the security and the resilience of the electoral system that underpins our democracy and will promote greater confidence in our democratic processes. in making these changes, we will bring our electoral system in line with others such as that in northern ireland or canada, which operate successful programmes, and recognise that there is an increasing expectation that someone ' s vote should be protected and carefully guarded. we already ask that people prove who they are in order to claim benefits, to rent a car or even to collect a parcel from the post office, so this is a proportionate and reasonable approach. democracy is precious and it is right to take that more robust approach to protect the integrity of the electoral process. the independent electoral commission has, since 2014, pushed for the introduction of id to strengthen the system, and it has welcomed the voter id pilots as a positive first step towards implementing its own recommendation that an accessible, proportionate voter identification scheme should be introduced in great britain. in a recent report for democratic audit uk, academic stuart wilks - heeg stated that, after the scheme was introduced in northern ireland, there was no evidence to suggest a fall in turnout, but that there was plenty of evidence that fraud declined sharply."", ""i congratulate my hon. friend the member for lewisham west and penge ( ellie reeves ) on securing the debate. i very much echo the concerns she raised. it is deeply concerning that voters, some of whom have voted their entire lives, were denied a voice in last month ' s local elections as a direct result of discriminatory policies introduced by this government. the government present voter identification as a solution to tackle the specific issue of voter impersonation in polling stations. electoral fraud is a serious crime and every allegation must be investigated fully. indeed, isolated incidents of electoral fraud have taken place and it is vital that the police have the resources they need to prosecute. however, the proposals outlined by the government are clearly disproportionate. in 2017 there were 28 allegations of impersonation out of nearly 45 million votes cast - one case for every 1. 6 million votes cast. of those 28 allegations, one case resulted in a conviction. none of the five english boroughs that took part in the pilots has experienced a single instance of impersonation in the past decade. the scale of electoral fraud in this country has caused many, including dr stuart wilks - heeg, head of politics at the university of liverpool, to describe voter id asa€œa solution in search of a problema€. does the minister agree with that assessment? the government clearly recognise the flaws in their argument. when pushed, they claim that voter identification is designed to tackle the perception of electoral fraud. however, new research published today by the electoral reform society shows that mandatory id in polling stations is one of voters ' lowest concerns - just 4 % of voters believe id is the most important priority for our democracy. the top issues for voters were : ensuring that elections are free from the influence of large financial donations, an accurate voting register and balanced media coverage.""]"

20, as part of a balanced approach to public spending, to ensure we have a strong and stable economy that is delivering the lowest level of unemployment for more than 40 years. the government have had to take difficult decisions in the last seven or eight years, but it is an important area of government spending. our ambitions for children and young people, when they are being looked after and afterwards, are the same as for any other child. we want them to fulfil their educational potential, have good health and wellbeing, build and maintain lasting relationships, and participate positively in society. of looked - after children, 74 % are in foster care. fostering provides stability, a safe and loving home and an alternative family environment. children and young people in foster care have made it clear that they want to feel part of a family and have a normal life. one of the essential messages from the a€œfoster care in englanda€ report is that foster care is working for many vulnerable children and young people. that needs to be celebrated. research tells us that, for many children in foster care, the experience can be positive and life - changing. coram ' s a€œour lives, our carea€ survey found that, in 2017, 83 % of 11 to 18 - year - olds living in care thought their life was getting better. research from the rees centre showed that stable, high - quality care can be a protective factor educationally, and children and young people in foster care perform better at school than looked - after children as a whole, and better than children in need."", 'my hon. friend makes his point extremely well. i know many foster - carers, and i am sure that other members here do too. the vast majority do exactly as he said : they provide an extremely supportive, loving and caring environment. they do their best to deliver the kinds of outcomes he mentioned, in the face of great difficulty, due, as he said, to the cuts forced upon local government. i have nothing but the highest regard for foster - carers and the work they do. i know from personal experience - as many members know, i have two adopted children - that when someone adopts, they are effectively a foster - carer for the period until the adoption goes through, with all the same rights, responsibilities, restrictions and interventions from the local authority and social workers that other foster - carers have. i know just how challenging that can be. during that period and since, i have met many foster - carers and seen just what a good job they do. i am glad that my hon. friend made that point. the question is how we ensure that foster - carers continue to get support, not least given the scale of the cuts. i shall develop that point. one of the challenges is delivering permanence for young people in care to ensure that they receive a long - term settled placement that is right for them. the government have placed enormous importance on children being adopted. as i said, i have two adopted children. it was decided that that was the best outcome for them. they have siblings who were not adopted, and for the vast majority of children who go into care, that is not the way forward. foster care is often a long - term option.', ""young people were consulted, but i will get back to the hon. gentleman on the precise number involved in the consultation. although there are areas of disagreement, there are three common themes. first, we need to ensure that enough high - quality fostering placements are available in the right place at the right time to meet the needs of children in the care system. secondly, we need to ensure that foster - parents receive the support and respect they need and deserve for the incredibly valuable role that they play in looking after children in care. thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, we need to ensure that children and young people are listened to, that their wishes and feelings are taken into account, and that they are involved in decisions about their lives. the hon. member for sefton central also raised the issue of adoption. stability and permanence are transformative for many children. for some children, long - term foster care will be the right choice. it is one of a range of options that includes adoptions and special guardianship, as he mentioned. the independent review asks the department to put permanence at the heart of policy making, and we agree that that is the right thing to do. foster - parents play a vital role in supporting some of our most vulnerable children. they are essential for achieving high ambitions for the children in their care. they are uniquely placed to recognise the child ' s needs and to respond to them appropriately. however, some foster - parents feel frustrated by the treatment they receive. we need to ensure that all foster - parents receive the support and respect they need for the incredibly valuable role that they play. the two fostering reports are clear that foster - parents are the experts in the children they look after and should be recognised as such.""]"

have we witnessed or heard reports of such behaviour by others but failed to act? how, collectively and individually, do we change behaviours and, most importantly, the culture in this place? it is barely three months since the house put in place the independent complaints and grievance scheme, which is aimed at tackling bullying, harassment and sexual harassment. while dame laura cox acknowledges that the new process contains much that is of value - i commend the leader of the house and her steering group for their efforts and determination in introducing the new scheme three months ago - she makes such fundamental criticisms of it that the house will have to revisit aspects of the scheme. indeed, the house of commons commission has moved quickly to accept her three key recommendations : that the valuing others and respect policies should be scrapped ; that complaints relating to historical allegations should be heard ; and that complaints by house of commons staff against members of the house should be determined througha€œan entirely independent process, in which members of parliament will play no parta€. this gives rise to detailed questions about implementation, and about ownership and responsibility for driving forward the recommendations for the implementation of the cox report.""]"

i hope the minister will be able to respond to my points. first, as ever, i must raise the issue of how the law deals with drivers who cause death through dangerous or careless driving. as many hon. members present will know, in october 2017, following a consultation, the ministry of justice announced a series of changes to the law on death by dangerous and careless driving, including life sentences for those who cause death by dangerous driving and for careless drivers who kill while under the influence of drink or drugs, as well as a new offence of causing serious injury through careless driving. the government now claim that those changes will be incorporated into a review of cycle safety. i have to say that that is completely unacceptable. it is right that the government review cycle laws, but it is just not good enough that the changes already announced to sentencing are being rolled into an open - ended process.', ""it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for redditch ( rachel maclean ). road safety is an issue that i repeatedly raise in the house, and i welcome the opportunity to debate it in the chamber this evening. we all know what a vital issue it is, and it affects many of our constituents, often tragically. in west yorkshire, 815 people were killed or seriously injured in road traffic incidents last year. in my constituency, more children are killed or seriously injured on our roads than almost anywhere else in the country. i know that it is ambitious, but we should aim to eliminate road deaths and serious injuries entirely in the uk. vision zero seeks to do exactly that, and i urge the government to look into that approach. clearly we will need a wide variety of tools in order to achieve that, and one crucial part is a tougher criminal justice approach. it was for this reason that i warmly welcomed the government ' s announcement in october 2017 that they would bring in longer sentences for drivers who killed through dangerous or careless driving, as well as the announcement of a new offence of causing serious injury through careless driving. i pay tribute to all those who campaigned for this change, including the road safety charity brake, but we are now over a year on, and the government have still not delivered on their commitment. in fact, we are no closer to those changes being made. ministers are now claiming that the changes will be incorporated into a review of cycle safety, but i have to say that that is completely unacceptable. it is right, of course, that the government should look at the laws around cycling in order to make it safer for all road users, but it is not good enough that already - announced changes on sentencing are being rolled into the open - ended process.""]"

corruption plan. i was delighted to play a role as a minister in the introduction of measures on beneficial ownership and the public register in this country through the small business, enterprise and employment act 2015. there was also an anti - corruption summit in 2016. however, there has been delay since then. at that time, the government committed themselves to legislate to increase transparency in the housing market and to require overseas companies that owned property to declare their beneficial ownership publicly. that was supposed to be in place by april, but now it, too, has been delayed. we will not see even a draft bill until the summer, and we will not get the actual legislation until next year. the issue of the overseas territories really matters. more than three quarters of corruption cases involving property that were investigated by the met ' s proceeds of corruption unit involved anonymous companies based in secrecy jurisdictions, and nearly four fifths of those were registered in either the overseas territories or the crown dependencies. as i have said, it is important that we get our house in order."", ""as most hon. members have stated in this debate, money laundering and corruption are huge issues worldwide. although i welcome some of the measures in the bill, i do not believe that it goes far enough. the minister for europe and the americas has already been made aware - it was mentioned in an intervention - that, as part of the recently agreed fifth eu anti - money laundering directive, all eu member states will be required to have public beneficial ownership registers by 2019. i am sure he will confirm that, whether or not the united kingdom is part of the eu at the time of the directive ' s implementation, the united kingdom would not want any measures that are weaker than those in the directive. this raises the question of what should happen in the overseas territories. the uk has made a start on a public beneficial ownership register, but more needs to be done in the overseas territories. as my right hon. friend the member for barking ( dame margaret hodge ) pointed out, the problem is that many overseas territories are tax havens and as such they are home to many offshore companies willing to offer complete anonymity to their clientele, with very few questions asked. we should note that, despite overseas territories having small populations, half of all global trade passes through them because they are tax havens, and the vast majority of the transactions are carried out by offshore companies. let us, for example, take the british virgin islands. despite having a population of only 28, 000, it is home to an estimated 500, 000 offshore companies, which is 40 % of the total number of offshore companies in the world. many of these offshore companies have complete anonymity and are shell companies working with nominees and powers of attorney to move around vast amounts of money. most people faced with that information would conclude that there is something dodgy going on. my right hon."", ""the bill commands general support on both sides of the house, and, like the hon. member for huntingdon ( mr djanogly ), who made an excellent speech, i welcome it. as currently drafted, however, it fails to include one vital measure that would at a stroke transform britain ' s contribution to the fight against money laundering, tax avoidance and evasion, corruption and financial crime. that measure has been debated many times in both houses, and is strongly supported by parliamentarians in all parties and by the all - party parliamentary group on responsible tax. we simply want to ensure that british overseas territories, many of which constitute the leading tax havens in the world, have registers of beneficial ownership that are public and open for anyone to interrogate : businesses, individuals, the press or civil society. i for one have had enough of the endless rhetoric proclaiming that britain is leading the global fight against corruption and money laundering. the reality has to start to match that rhetoric, because at present it does not. by failing to insist that our overseas territories have public registers of beneficial ownership, we are complicit in facilitating the very corruption that we claim to want to eradicate. our overseas territories play a central role in the scourge that is corruption, tax evasion and money laundering. of the 200, 000 companies exposed in the panama papers, more than half were registered in the british virgin islands, a uk overseas territory. more than half the offices of the law firm appleby that were exposed in the paradise papers are located in uk -

how prisoners were treated was unacceptable, and the lack of purposeful activity was unacceptable. we are now addressing this hard and quickly, but there are still huge lessons to be learned through the system. i pay tribute to the new governor, pia sinha, who has come in, taken cells out of commission and made it clear that she has cleaned the prison and that her objective over the next six months is to get those cells into a smart, good condition. we now have the money in place to put in the new windows and she is focused on ensuring that the education and employment activity is good. more generally, there are lessons right the way through the prison system. we need to get the basics right. there is no point talking about rehabilitation or dealing with reoffending unless we have clean, decent and safe spaces for all prisoners. we want our prisons to be smart and well - functioning. we are bringing in more than 2, 000 more prison officers, and that will relieve some of the pressures on the prison estate, but these are new prison officers and will need training and support until they have the prisoncraft to deliver what we require.', 'bearing in mind your warning, mr speaker, i will try to deal with those four quite different questions briefly, but they are serious questions that are worth spending a little time on. the question about numbers is a good one. during the previous labour government, the number of people in prison rose from about 40, 000 to nearly 80, 000 - the prison population nearly doubled - so we inherited a prison estate with an enormous number of prisoners. that involves a serious conversation right across the house about the number of people we wish to put in prison, and that goes beyond this question about bedford. however, we will undertake to look carefully at the population of bedford prison and at the ratio between prison officers and prisoners, and we will come back within 28 days to the chief inspector of prisons with an answer laying out a plan. the second question is on the building at bedford, which of course dates from the early 1800s, as the hon. gentleman said. although we have a new wing in place, a lot of the physical infrastructure is very difficult, which is unfortunately true not only of bedford. a third of the current prison estate was built before 1900 - these are victorian prisons - which is why we will be spending the money to create 10, 000 new prison places with modern accommodation. there is a very clear relationship between old buildings and this type of problem, and only new investment and new builds will solve it. on recruitment and retention, bedford has, as the hon. gentleman knows, quite a challenging job market. wages have been rising, employment figures are quite high and bedford is relatively close to the commuter belt, which means we have had some struggle recruiting and retaining. we now have 3, 500 more prison officers in place than we had in 2015. we need to invest more in training them, and we need to invest more in making sure they stay. the hon.', ""the chief inspector of prisons has spoken of the continual and unchecked decline in standards at the prison over the past nine years. he also said that, at times, it felt like the prisoners were in control. this is the prison with the highest rate of assaults in the country. some 77 % of prison officers at hmp bedford have less than one year ' s service. that is the reality, so i am disappointed that, in his seven minutes, the minister said a lot but avoided the specific question at hand on hmp bedford. i thank my hon. friend the member for bedford ( mohammad yasin ) for his tireless work on exposing the failings at the prison. as we have heard, this is the fourth jail in just 12 months to be issued an urgent notification. formally, the minister has to publish a plan of action for the prison within 28 days, but we need answers today. the government ' s recent solution to the widespread failure at hmp birmingham was to increase prison staff and reduce prisoner numbers there. will the minister commit today to a similar increase in staff and reduction in prisoner numbers at bedford? there was a riot at bedford in november 2016. what have the government done since to improve the situation, bearing in mind what the chief inspector of prisons has said? whose fault is it that in the latest annual performance figures, hmp bedford is still labelled as a prison of serious concern? it remains one of the most overcrowded prisons in the country - 40 % over capacity. what has the minister done, and what have the government done, to tackle overcrowding there since the 2016 riot? more widely, what plans do the government have to end overcrowding across the prison estate, given that over half of prisons are overcrowded?""]"

it is a fallacy to believe that people who profess to be anti - racist cannot be anti - semitic, and that anti - semitism is confined to the right wing of politics. the notion of conspiratorial, powerful jews - or zionists - controlling international capital and manipulating the media for their own ends is to be found on the left as well. it is all too evident in the labour party ' s current problem with anti - semitism. the small british jewish community - less than 0. 5 % of the population - is increasingly disturbed by the growth and normalisation of anti - semitism."", ""i will not give way to the hon. lady because i have given way twice already and i do not want to take up too much time. i am glad that we will have our own holocaust museum alongside the palace of westminster, and i look forward to that being developed so that we can bring young people here to see the importance of that element of society. there are also actions that we can all take. i was proud to sponsor early - day motion 743 for holocaust memorial day, and i believe that 55 right hon. and hon. members have signed it so far. the book of commitment will be available for members to sign each day next week between 2pm and 4pm close to the members ' cloakroom, and i commend that to all members. we also have the challenge of combating anti - semitism on university campuses. one current challenge is that many jewish children go to jewish schools and are not exposed to anti - semitism until they get to university. in my view, we are not preparing our young people sufficiently for what they may face, and i am delighted that the government are taking action to combat anti - semitism on university campuses by sponsoring visits for sabbatical officers to go to auschwitz - birkenau and to see at first hand what can happen if matters get out of hand. as we have said, the holocaust started with words and other forms of anti - semitism, and expanded to what we have seen in the death camps. we must commend all those who speak out against anti - semitism, from whichever political party. i was proud recently to share a platform with hon. friends on the opposition benches at my local synagogue, stanmore synagogue, for a question and answer session, during which i commended them for their bravery in standing up and calling out anti - semitism in their own party.""]"

in my view and, i think, all our views, it is even more important to the united kingdom because of the connectivity for the east of england. research from the brilliant essex chamber of commerce, a great champion of strategic infrastructure improvements across essex that has campaigned and worked with the business community, has shown that 56 % of essex businesses that responded to its survey regularly use the a120. only the a12 at 82 % and the m25 at 72 % were used more than the a120. however, the government know, and have heard not just from me but from successive members of parliament from the east of england over the last decade and more, that the a120 is not fit for purpose. it needs investment to unlock future economic growth and jobs. the a120 is also a dangerous road.']"

sided approach, but one of the most important things that can be done is to integrate information about donation into the formal curriculum, which the review recommends. we already know that education works. for example, anthony nolan and other blood disorder charities have had great success working with schools, universities and colleges across the uk. just last month, i wrote a letter to all schools with a sixth form in or near my constituency to ask whether they would consider using an assembly or personal, social, health and economic lessons to teach students about the importance of donating stem cells, blood and organs. i am delighted that one of the schools has already agreed to do so. since the hero project started in 2009, more than 32, 000 people have signed up to the anthony nolan stem cell donor register, and approximately 16 % of them are from a bame background. the hero project recognises that the different religious views about organ donation are one of the barriers preventing people from signing up to the organ donation register. anthony nolan and other blood disorder charities recognise and respect those diverse views and tailor their message to suit different interpretations of faith. they focus on what people can do to help, not on what they cannot do. the review found that the three main barriers that prevent people from signing up are a lack of knowledge or awareness, religious permissibility and a lack of trust in medical institutions. the opt -

perhaps for cultural reasons - to discuss the issue within the family, or perhaps a lack of access to knowledge about the way that the organ donation system works. there are a number of issues, but is simply iniquitous that the bame community should suffer more, for whatever reason, and that is why the bill is so welcome and necessary.', ""i thank my hon. friend the member for coventry north west ( mr robinson ) for introducing this important private member ' s bill. the nhs has just reached the historic milestone of 70 years. as a country and as a society, we are proud of the landmark advances we have made within that time. because of advances in organ donation and transplantation, 50, 000 people are alive today. most people are willing to donate their organs after they die, but only 36 % of the population are on the organ donation register. organ donation is increasing gradually, but sadly it is not keeping pace with the number of people on the transplant waiting list. the british heart foundation highlights the fact that an average of three people per day die in need of an organ. as someone who was a cardiac nurse in a previous job, i am only too aware of how desperate a patient can become when waiting for an organ to become available. i saw at first hand the distress that people suffered while waiting for a heart transplant or for another organ. in spain and belgium, a softer opt - out approach has facilitated a cultural change that has generated higher donor rates. that is why i am here today supporting my hon. friend ' s bill, which will address this bleak statistic and bring the discussion of organ donation back to the dinner tables of families across the uk. i also express my sincere thanks to the daily mirror for its campaign in support of the bill, which has shown the public the gift of life that is given by those who donate organs. one organ donor can transform as many as nine people ' s lives. as has been mentioned, the uk has one of the lowest family consent rates in europe. in wales, the welsh government bravely introduced deemed consent.""]"

disclosure of parole board decisions have been called into question. the judgment quashes the parole board ' s decision to release worboys and finds that rule 25 of the parole board rules is unlawful. this means that worboys ' case will now be resubmitted to the parole board. a new panel will be constituted, and updated evidence on his risk from prison and probation professionals will be provided. the panel will then assess anew whether worboys is suitable for release. those victims covered by the victim contact scheme will be fully informed and involved in this process. my department also has to reformulate the parole board ' s rules to allow more transparency around decision making and reasoning. it is clear that there was widespread concern about the decision by the parole board to release worboys. as i have previously told the house, i share those concerns and, consequently, i welcome this judgment. i congratulate the victims who brought the judicial review and reiterate my heartfelt sympathy for all victims who have suffered as a result of worboys ' hideous crimes. i want to set out, in greater detail than i have previously been able to set out, the reasons why i did not bring a judicial review."", ""i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement on today ' s high court decision. today ' s unprecedented ruling, made possible by the human rights act, clearly highlights the deep flaws in the initial parole board decision. that initial decision clearly caused anguish for the victims -

managed trees, woodlands and forests have a role in the countryside and the urban environment, which is why it is so disappointing that certain councils seem hellbent on removing trees from city streets. i am sure my right hon. friend the member for chipping barnet ( theresa villiers ) is keen to ensure the mayor of london keeps his pre -

party approach to planting trees for the future, as governments of all persuasions come and go, that is probably the one thing that we can agree on. seriously, trees breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen, so they are good not only in the countryside but in our cities. they can be our lungs for the future. we can also make much more of our wood industry. we can have everything if we do it in the right way. my final point, as i started the debate, is that as we plant more woodland, we should ensure that it is a mixture of trees and landscapes, so as to provide good access to such forest for all people, whether it is recreational or good for the environment and carbon capture. it can also be good for our future to have more wood in our houses. motion lapsed ( standing order no. 10 ( 6 ) ).']"

the appointment of the first victims ' commissioner to champion the interests of victims and witnesses in 2010 ; and the publication of a€œgetting it right for victims and witnessesa€ in 2012, which set out the government ' s approach to ensuring that victims and witnesses get the support they need. the victims strategy consolidates and builds on that progress but recognises that more still needs to be done. i thank and pay tribute to all the victims, victims ' groups and experts who have willingly shared their experiences and sat on the victims panel, and to my predecessor, my hon. friend the member for bracknell ( dr lee ), who initiated this work."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mrs main. it has been a pleasure to hear all the contributions this afternoon, especially that of my hon. friend the member for telford ( lucy allan ). i hope i can go some way to answer all the questions, including the battery of questions that the shadow minister just posed. if i do not answer the questions appropriately, hon. members will get correspondence following the debate. i thank the hon. member for leeds north west ( alex sobel ) for securing this debate on the rights of victims of crime. it is particularly timely given the recent focus on such matters in a number of high - profile cases. i know through my own personal experience of meeting victims of crime, speaking with support organisations and meeting many of the hon. members present, exactly how important such rights are in the lives of victims. i am therefore grateful for the opportunity to discuss them with you today. victims ' rights are now a fundamental part of our justice system, and ensuring that victims receive the rights they are entitled to is a priority for this government. that is essential if we are to enable victims to cope with and recover from crime. we must also continue to drive improvement in the broader experience of victims, which involves ensuring that criminal justice agencies provide victims with a service appropriate to their needs and respectful of them as individuals. that also requires focus on the wider performance of agencies. victims want cases to be well managed and dealt with swiftly. beyond the criminal justice agencies, it is important that victim support services are in a position to offer victims the sorts of support they may need to aid their long - term recovery. turning to the current framework of victims ' rights, we look first to the statutory victims code, which does two fundamentally important things. first, it sets out for victims exactly what they are entitled to receive from the criminal justice system.""]"

up of civil partnership and marriage among same - sex couples. since 2013, when marriage was introduced for same - sex couples, an increasing number of couples have chosen marriage instead of civil partnerships. we do not know, however, whether the current levels of demand will be sustained or whether they will change over time. we currently have only two full years of data for civil partnership formation following the introduction of marriage for same - sex couples. given the scale and significance of the decision, it is proportionate to gather more data so that we can be sure that demand has stabilised. our assessment is that we will have a proportionate amount of evidence by september 2019 to be confident in assessing the ongoing level of demand for civil partnerships among same - sex couples. the second piece of work that we are committing to undertake relates to those already in civil partnerships. we continue to consider whether phasing out civil partnerships for same - sex couples is the best way forward. we want to approach the issue sensitively and delicately because it would be wrong to rush towards a decision without understanding how it would affect same - sex couples who continue to opt for a civil partnership and who do not wish to convert their civil partnership into a marriage. we are therefore committing to undertake research with same - sex couples to understand their motivations for forming and remaining in a civil partnership, and what they may do if the evidence drives us to remove them.', ""i congratulate the hon. member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ) on introducing such an important bill. i am proud that the landmark policy of civil partnerships was introduced by labour. we took a stand long before it was considered fashionable or acceptable. we took a stand to allow lesbian, gay and bisexual people to have their relationships recognised by law and to have benefits equal to those for married couples. that proud moment built on labour ' s history of fighting for the equal rights of lgbtq + people, and the civil partnership act 2004 paved the way for same sex marriage. following the passing of same sex - marriage legislation, it is a complete anomaly and unjustice that civil partnerships are not available to all, an anomaly that the government could have easily rectified and would have received support from both sides of the house to do so. although i was not a member at the time, it is clear that the only reason labour did not push further to extend civil partnerships during the passage of the marriage ( same sex couples ) act 2013 was for fear of losing it altogether. we were met with much hostility when we introduced civil partnerships, but we were on a mission to ensure some level of equality as quickly as possible, and we achieved just that. times have now moved on, but it appears that some attitudes have not. allowing some couples to choose whether to marry or to enter a civil partnership while others cannot is no equality at all. that anomaly is not in the spirit of either the civil partnership act or the marriage ( same sex couples ) act, which are based firmly in parity and not in the semantics that are often used to hide bigotry and prejudice. labour members believe that all people should be equal before the law."", ""i echo the support that has been expressed for the bill, which will ensure the registration of stillbirths before 24 weeks and give coroners the power to investigate stillbirths. i will concentrate on the clauses that address civil partnerships. i stress that i understand the case that hon. members have made today, and i applaud the passion of my hon. friend the member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ) for this topic. although i welcome a report and a review to find more evidence, i think that rolling out civil partnerships to everyone is not the right approach, as i am confident such a review would highlight. it is time to refresh our minds as to why civil partnerships were invented. they were invented because same - sex marriage was not legal. civil partnerships were not intended to be a permanent alternative to marriage. they were created to allow same - sex couples access to rights, responsibilities and protections equivalent to those afforded to married couples. that is no longer the case. i appreciate and empathise with the argument that the current situation is unequal because opposite - sex civil partnerships are not available, but the answer is not necessarily to expand civil partnerships. in fact, i would rather see civil partnerships cease altogether. today everyone in the uk can get married. we finally have equality, which is what people have campaigned for and fought for. expanding civil partnerships to all would serve to add an extra tier, which would confuse and complicate commitment, rather than encouraging it. let us also be clear that there is no legal difference between marriage and civil partnership. the differences are in the names, in the ceremonies and the fact that women are, of course, named on their children ' s civil partnership certificates, but we can address that separately - i passionately believe in naming women on their children ' s marriage certificates.""]"

it is a question of how to make it safe and as enjoyable as possible. the rules are out - of - date and we need our government to act. it is clear from the turnout how many mps this campaign has reached. i was pleased to host an event on this important issue for the football supporters federation, safety experts and parliamentary colleagues before today ' s debate. safe standing is an issue whose time has come, a fact borne out by the simple numbers. it is borne out by its successful use outside the top two flights week in, week out. it is borne out by the 94 % of fans surveyed by the efl, who made it clear that they wanted a choice in the type of match day experience they had. it is also borne out by the more than 100, 000 football fans and supporters who signed the petition to secure today ' s debate. fans want safe standing even if they do not want it for themselves, and it is increasingly clear that clubs want safe standing, too. i was delighted that earlier this month my hon. friend the member for tooting ( dr allin - khan ) announced that the labour party backs safe standing. i salute her leadership on the issue."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr robertson. i shall try to make some comments while ignoring the taunting of the portsmouth fan on the opposition benches to my right - although it is difficult to ignore. if we want to see who is successful in football, we need only note that southampton has survived in the premier league again this year, while pompey languishes somewhere closer to the sunday leagues. all - seater stadiums have been required by law since 1994. there were good reasons for introducing them, but i think that now is the time to consider whether we can have safe standing as well as seating. safe standing has been trialled and is now accepted as being safe. in 2011 the scottish premier league relaxed its requirement for all - seater stadiums and celtic, as has been mentioned, now has a safe standing space for 3, 000 supporters. next season, league one team shrewsbury town will join celtic and have its own safe standing area. the stunning st mary ' s stadium in southampton has a capacity of more than 32, 000. frequently 32, 000 fans attend to watch - unlike at portsmouth, not far down the road. the saints moved from the iconic dell ground in 2000. we used to stand on the terraces until the move to the new stadium. many football fans want to continue to stand, and southampton fans are no exception. fans in the northam stand all too often still stand, although by law they should not. that presents the club with a difficult decision about how to police the situation ; thus far it has not managed to do it. however, the situation proves that safe standing, even in an environment where there is standing between seats, has been safe for some 18 years at southampton football club."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr robertson. i want to thank the chair of the pompey supporters trust, simon colebrook, for talking with me about the issue, as well as our excellent shadow minister, my hon. friend the member for tooting ( dr allin - khan ), who has led our party in backing safe standing across the football league. i thank, also, the owner of portsmouth football club, who has written to me about this important issue today. in a debate about safe standing in championship and premier league games, pompey fans will be painfully aware that, despite a prolific history of european and top division football, not to mention multiple fa cup wins, our club are currently enjoying a short break from the pressures of the premier league. nevertheless, our time in this country ' s top two divisions means that, under current legislation, we are required permanently to remain all - seater. our club is therefore a prime example of the injustice of the government ' s stance on safe standing, because in reality the issue is not whether to bring safe standing into football grounds ; it is already there. when portsmouth fans travel to the grounds of bristol rovers, peterborough united, wycombe wanderers and countless other sides in the football league, they see stadiums where fully licensed standing sections are operated. yet back at fratton park they have no choice : standing sections are not allowed. that is all because we previously spent more than three seasons in the top two tiers. i must admit that i am puzzled about why the government think standing becomes safer as the quality of football gets worse. if that is true, southampton fans should not be made to sit. why should divisional status - and historical divisional status, at that - have implications for whether clubs can have standing sections at their grounds?""]"

including chalk streams - bring further challenges. a water company ' s job is to take account of those factors and to provide a reliable supply of safe drinking water. the government and the water regulator ' s job is to check that they are doing that effectively. thames water supplies water to about 10 million household customers and 215, 000 businesses in london and across the thames valley. its existing plan shows a one -

we take them away from their environment and put them somewhere separate, where they generally respond much better. if people have committed crimes, they should have that impingement placed on them. the use of that technology should be denied them. i think that the purpose of the bill - i did not serve on the public bill committee, so i stand to be corrected on this - is to strengthen safety and security in prisons, through the authorisation of interference of public communications. in 2016 the government published plans for reforming the prison system, including the measures in the bill. the a€œprison safety and reforma€ white paper set out the government ' s plans to deliver a mix of operational changes and to underpin the legal changes required. our prisons face significant security challenges. in 2016, approximately 13, 000 mobile phones and 7, 000 sim cards were found in prisons - an incredible number. that was an increase of 7, 000 mobile phones from 2013."", 'the hon. lady is quite right, and i will go on to explain how mobile phones are used to continue crime in our prison service. to reiterate, last year 23, 656 mobile phones were found in our prisons, which is nearly 65 a day. in my constituency, 184 mobile phones and 80 sim cards were found at hmp lewes last year, and having visited the prison regularly and met prison officers and the governor, i have heard at first hand the implications of that. as the hon. lady pointed out, illegal mobile phones present a serious risk to the security of our prisons, as well as to public safety. mobile phones in prisons are used for a range of criminal purposes, including commissioning serious violence, harassing victims, and continuing involvement in extremist activity and organised crime. access to mobile phones is strongly associated with drug supplies and violence in our prisons, so it is a serious problem. it might be argued that the prison service should be better at stopping mobiles entering our prisons in the first place, but as the previous justice secretary made clear in a speech to reform in december last year, technological advances have been harnessed by some manufacturers with the clear intention of circumventing prison security measures. technological advances have made it possible to manufacture phones so small, and containing so little metal, that they can be concealed internally and are difficult to detect with existing screening machines. phones have been marketed as a€œbeat the bossa€, which refers to the body orifice security scanner that is in use in our prison receptions. however, just as technology can be harnessed for illicit ends, we can also enlist its support to improve the effectiveness of our response to the problem. public communications providers such as mobile phone operators have been at the forefront of rapid technological developments in mobile communications.', ""this welcome bill goes some way to addressing the issues surrounding mobile phones in prison, and as my hon. friend the member for west ham ( lyn brown ) said, evidence has shown time and again that mobile phones have been smuggled into prison for use by inmates, often to enable them to engage in further illegal activity. they are used illicitly to order drugs, harass victims, and organise crime, both inside and outside the prison. the use of phones for such activities is completely unacceptable, but figures indicate that the number of phones conveyed into prisons for use by inmates is increasing. the hon. member for lewes ( maria caulfield ) gave some figures, and i shall present some others that show a similar trend. in 2013, there were around 7, 500 reported incidences of mobile phones and sim cards being found in prison, but by 2015 that figure had increased to nearly 17, 000. mobile phone use in prisons is a problem that needs tackling, and the bill is a welcome step forward. i might question whether back benchers should be driving forward legislation to tackle illegal prison activity, rather than the government, but nevertheless the ability to interfere with wireless telegraphy and to disrupt mobile phone use in a designated, specified area could have a significant impact in reducing the use of mobile phones and, subsequently, any further illegal activity through their use. although the bill goes some way to addressing organised violence and drugs in prisons, it cannot be seen as a panacea to end the problems in our prisons. violence, drugs, and further crime are not helped by the government ' s treatment of our prisons system, which has produced an environment that allows them to flourish. the government ' s decision to slash prison budgets, axe prison officers and neglect our prisons has led to overcrowding and violence.""]"

we would have substantially less consensus. a lot of our fur imports come from countries that have lower animal welfare standards than the uk has, even before we introduced the fur farming ban. in some countries, the standards are simply non - existent. the select committee on environment, food and rural affairs, which i am a member of, has just conducted an inquiry into fake faux fur, where people are misled into buying real fur when they think they are buying cheap faux fur. we heard about the conditions on some of the fur farms in other countries. the idea of ethical fur farming, even in countries which purport to be high - welfare, has been shown time and again to be a complete fiction. a recent investigation by the daily mirror into saga - certified fur farms in finland found morbidly obese foxes that had been grossly overfed and selectively bred to have large folds of skin so that they would produce more fur. this kind of breeding causes an array of health problems for the foxes, including poor reproduction, metabolic disorders and even dna damage, which cannot easily be identified by the brief visual inspection required for a fur farm to become certified. one awful symptom seen repeatedly is foxes having bent and malformed feet, which occurs due to their forced obesity. that is hugely painful for the animals and severely impedes their mobility, sight and ability to breathe. there is a parallel with how birds are force - fed for the production of foie gras, which leads to their inability to lift themselves off the ground because they are so obese. this is not just happening on one rogue farm on a bad day."", 'the hon. gentleman is prescient. i will come on to fake fur later, and i agree with his observations. since the implementation of the ban, we have effectively continued fur farming internationally, by allowing in fur imports. some estimates put the value of the fur imported at a£670 million. humane society international, which has campaigned powerfully on the issue, estimates that, based on the value of pelts at auction houses, that may equate to some 2 million animal skins imported into the uk in 2016 alone. i want to say a little more about the conditions in which animals are kept. beyond the simple idea that farming animals simply for their fur is wrong, the animals in fur farms are too often forced to live in terrible conditions. humane society international recently held a drop - in for mps, and i am sure that some colleagues present for the debate will have attended it. we saw harrowing videos of how animals are treated in the fur trade, and we saw examples of cages and the very small spaces in which animals farmed for fur spend their entire lives. it was a very graphic demonstration of what we are talking about, and it is not easily forgotten - as it should not be. there is plenty of expert scientific evidence. the european commission scientific committee on animal health and animal welfare puts it clearly : a€œcurrent husbandry systems cause serious problems for all species of animals reared for fura€. as we have heard, animals such as foxes and minks are suited in their natural habitat to roam far and wide. when those animals are farmed for fur they are kept in small cages less than 1 metre square.', ""i once again find myself very much in agreement with my right hon. friend. my conclusion is very much on those lines, which you will be glad to know i am finally coming to, mr hollobone. the government ' s response to the petition said : a€œwhile some fur products may never be legally imported into the uk the government ' s view is that national bans are less effective than working at an international level on animal welfare standards. a€that sounds very laudable, although it is in fact civil service waffle. i hope the minister will show some more ambition, exactly as has been suggested. the government ' s response sets up a false dichotomy. a national ban would not stop our government from continuing to work on international animal welfare, and it would give our country a firm platform from which to work with others. we should be leading, as we should be in europe generally. having had a quick glance at the house of commons facebook page and its coverage of the debate, i have to say that i do not think i saw one comment advocating maintaining the import of fur into this country. the vast engagement seems to be entirely on the side of a fur ban, which also seems to reflect the feelings and the comments made by hon. members. the eu banned the import and export of cat and dog fur in 2008, and the fur free alliance has active campaigns across the world. new zealand prohibits mink fur imports ; india banned imports of several species of fur ; sa£o paulo adopted a fur farming ban in 2014 and an import and sales ban in 2015 ; and west hollywood became the first city in the world to ban the sale of fur in 2013. a few months ago, san francisco became the largest world city to ban the sale of fur.""]"

and effectiveness and efficiency of available office space. i want to argue today that the west midlands should be the choice for channel 4 to meet those criteria.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the relocation of channel 4. it is a pleasure to see you in the chair, sir graham. channel 4 is undoubtedly one of our finest, most precious broadcasting assets, as evidenced by the fact that there has been intense interest from many cities and regions across the united kingdom in hosting its new national headquarters and new creative hubs, representing 300 new channel 4 jobs, which will not only expand its footprint across the united kingdom but deepen its relationship with viewers. rightly, channel 4 has set a high bar for bidding cities and regions, requiring robust local infrastructure and transport and, in particular, frequent, fast and reliable connectivity. for the national headquarters, it is looking for a home with a population of at least 200, 000, travel time to the city of london within three hours and a high level of physical and digital connectivity. as a glasgow member of parliament, i am sure right hon. and hon. members will understand that i am immensely pleased to see that my home city is putting in a bold, strong and ambitious bid to be the new home of channel 4. i am particularly pleased that the chair of that bid is the famous glaswegian journalist and broadcaster stuart cosgrove. beyond channel 4 ' s physical requirements, it is ultimately looking for somewhere it can feel at home. it is looking for a diverse city that has a thriving arts and production scene ; a city that is not afraid to go against the grain ; and a city that has a confident sense of itself but is always looking to stretch itself and take on new challenges. setting aside the physical criteria, i wish to set out the case for scotland ' s largest city. the truth is that if channel 4 was a city, it would be the city of glasgow.""]"

building of the andsf.', ""with permission, mr speaker, i will make a statement on afghanistan. the united kingdom will never forget the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks and the thousands of innocent women, men and children killed in the atrocity. that barbaric violence prompted the uk, alongside our nato allies, to enter afghanistan to ensure that terrorists could not use it as a base from which to attack our citizens at home or abroad. before i continue, i want to pay tribute to the efforts of the tens of thousands of brave british men and women who have served in afghanistan for the past 16 years. we will never forget what they did, particularly those 456 brave men and women who paid the ultimate price and those who suffered life - changing injuries in the line of duty. their service and sacrifice has not been in vain. as i saw when i visited back in march, not only do millions of ordinary afghans now have access to clean water, vital medicine and education, which would not have seemed possible less than 20 years ago, not only have they enabled the afghan people to take charge of their own security, and not only is the capability of the afghan national defence and security forces growing, but elections are giving a voice to the people of afghanistan, who are increasingly calling for peace, which would have been unthinkable a short time ago. our commitment to afghanistan remains an enduring one. although uk combat operations ended in 2014, our troops are playing a key role in nato ' s resolute support mission by leading the kabul security force. they are performing a vital role in training, advising and assisting the afghan national army and air force and developing the nationwide security structures that will strengthen afghanistan ' s democracy. they have a quick reaction force that works alongside the afghan army to provide urgent help in kabul if and when required."", 'the hon. lady raises a very serious issue. the terrorist attack that she refers to was indeed appalling. as she said, too many victims lost their lives as a result of that attack that took place in afghanistan. it is important that we ensure that we are providing support, as we do through our contribution in afghanistan. that is a contribution to security in the kabul area specifically from our forces, but it is also about working with others to ensure that the afghan security forces are able to provide security and safety for all communities living in afghanistan. tremendous achievements have been made in afghanistan today, compared with the situation before these efforts, but sadly, as the hon. lady highlights, too many terrorist attacks are still taking place in afghanistan. we will continue to work with our allies and the afghan government to prevent these in future and to ensure that people can go about their daily lives in safety and security and with confidence.']"

the latest figures show that services for deaf children are reducing across england. that means that their futures are being a€œstolena€, as the national deaf children ' s society puts it, because without the support, intervention and specialist skills that they need, they will not be able to make the best educational and social progress compared with other children who are not deaf or hearing impaired. that cannot be right. there are more than 50, 000 deaf children and young people in the uk. as we have heard, more than 90 % of them are born to hearing parents who have no prior experience of deafness. some 80 % of those children attend mainstream schools, where they may be the only deaf child in their school. figures from the national deaf children ' s society show a stark difference in educational achievement as it is. in the early years foundation stage, 34 % of pre - school deaf children were reported as having a good level of development compared with 76 % of other children. at key stage 2, less than half of deaf children achieved the expected standard for reading, compared with 80 % of other children. at key stage 4, deaf children achieve, on average, a whole grade less in each gcse subject than other children. in recent years this attainment gap has widened."", ""i thank my hon. friend for that intervention. i agree with that statement, and i hope to explain why. the petitioners want bsl to be part of the national curriculum, giving better life chances to young people who are deaf. they believe that if bsl becomes part of the national curriculum, that will even up the chances of deaf young people being able to play a full part in school and attain the best results they can. let us look at the case. research by the national deaf children ' s society into the attainment of deaf children in 2017 shows that deaf children continue to underachieve throughout their education compared with other children. although the department for education claimed recently that attainment for deaf children is at an all - time high, the latest figures show that the attainment gap between deaf children and children with no identified special needs is widening, with the gap at gcse level being particularly worrying. in 2016, 41. 3 % of deaf children achieved the expected benchmark of five gcses at a * to c grade, compared with 69. 3 % of children with no identified special needs. that is a difference of more than 20 %, which is just not acceptable in this day and age. all that is in the context of a reduction of 14 % in the number of qualified teachers of the deaf since 2011, and a 2 % reduction in just one year - 2016 - 17. we know that we have to do more to help deaf pupils to achieve their full potential and that we need to reverse the reduction in the number of teachers of the deaf. we can do that partly by ensuring that young deaf pupils are able to have effective communication. for many, that will be through bsl. bsl has been a recognised language since 2003, but unlike other languages it is not recognised as a gcse that can be taught in schools.""]"

winning scientist, the word a€œmuslima€ has been erased from his gravestone, under a court order. electoral disenfranchisement, discrimination in law and expulsion by society have left the ahmadi community in pakistan voiceless. so today we must be their voice, for even the constraints of life provide no constraints for the persecution that an ahmadi in pakistan may face. such persecution, however, is found not just in pakistan, algeria, egypt, burundi and indonesia - it can be found right here in the uk, right on our doorstep. over recent weeks, the all - party parliamentary group on the ahmadiyya muslim community, which i proudly chair, has been running a five - part inquiry into the persecution faced by the ahmadi community. we have heard the testimony of dozens of ahmadi men and women, describing the scale of hatred that they have faced. it is truly shocking. the most stark and shocking example in the uk took place just two years ago in glasgow, where ahmadi shopkeeper asad shah was brutally murdered."", ""i absolutely agree with my hon. friend. in indonesia, ahmadiyya is not an authorised religion. so when an ahmadi tries to secure identity documents requiring an authorised religion to be shown, they simply cannot get them. furthermore, ahmadi mosques have been burned down, ahmadis have been denied their voting rights, and they have been driven out of their homes, as my hon. friend said. i am afraid to say that in indonesia the persecution comes from the very top. in 2008 a joint ministerial decree introduced by the minister of religious affairs, the attorney general and the minister of home affairs prohibited the promulgation of ahmadiyya teachings. the minister of religious affairs followed this up with calls for an outright ban against the ahmadis in 2011. but perhaps the persecution is best illustrated by the calls from the governor of west java, who claimed there would be no violence against the ahmadiyya community if there were no ahmadi teachings or practices. the a€œproblema€, he suggests, a€œwill disappear if the belief disappears. a€it is no wonder therefore that just last weekend 23 ahmadis sought refuge at east lombok police station, escaping after an angry mob destroyed their homes in an attempt to expel them from the area. away from indonesia, there are currently 10, 000 ahmadi refugees stuck in limbo in countries including sri lanka, malaysia and thailand, all having fled persecution in their home countries. sri lanka even tried to deport 88 ahmadis back to pakistan in 2014 despite claims that they could be at risk in their homeland, and so it is to pakistan that i now turn. for it is in pakistan that the world ' s largest ahmadi community exists, with an estimated 4 million members, and it is there that the persecution ahmadis face can perhaps be most prominently found."", 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr walker. it is also a pleasure to follow the hon. member for torbay ( kevin foster ). i thank the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) for securing this incredibly important debate and for his tireless campaign for all those around the world who are persecuted because of their faith. as the proud chair of the all - party parliamentary group for the ahmadiyya muslim community, my contribution will focus largely on the persecution of the ahmadis. one of the largest mosques in western europe is on the border of my constituency. as several hon. members have said, the community identifies as muslim but does not believe that mohammed was the final prophet sent to guide mankind. that belief has led to widespread persecution across the world, and, i am afraid to say, even in the uk, as has been mentioned. i will take hon. members on a global tour, from indonesia to islamabad, bangkok to burundi, and describe the day - to - day reality faced by the community. in algeria, 280 ahmadi muslims have been arrested on the grounds of their faith in the last two years alone. in burundi, 13 young ahmadis were arrested earlier this year while attending a religious education class. in egypt, the interior minister started the year by issuing arrest warrants for at least 25 ahmadis, including the publications secretary for the ahmadiyya muslim community. in kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan, ahmadis are the only international religious group denied the right to register as a religious community. in indonesia, ahmadiyya muslim is not even an authorised religion. in pakistan, as we have heard, it is a criminal offence for ahmadis to call themselves muslim, name their place of worship a mosque or even say the islamic greeting. hundreds of ahmadis have been murdered in pakistan.']"

teenage mothers are nearly four times as likely to smoke before or during pregnancy than those aged 35 and over. young mothers are less likely to quit before or during pregnancy, and only 38 % of mothers under the age of 20 did so, compared with 58 % of mothers aged 35 or above. it is clear that the government need to tackle smoking in pregnancy, and smoking in childhood, as a matter of urgency to achieve their ambition of a smoke - free generation. the minister and his department have a huge challenge on their hands if they are to meet the ambitious targets set out in the tobacco control plan. i still welcome the plan as the right thing to do, as i am sure the minister does. anything that is worth doing is going to be hard. we have four years to go before the target date, and the minister must now look at how the government can properly fund smoking cessation services to drive down smoking rates and support those who need extra help to stop smoking. i look forward to the remainder of the debate and the minister ' s closing remarks."", ""i beg to move, that leave be given to bring in a bill to require the secretary of state to report on means of requiring tobacco companies to meet the costs of smoking cessation services ; to make provision about the advertising and marketing of products that are alternatives to tobacco ; to require tobacco companies to publish information about their activities in relation to such products ; to create an offence of selling tobacco without a licence ; and for connected purposes. in 1990, almost one third of adults in great britain smoked. the most recent figures show that this has almost halved - the prevalence rate is now 15. 8 %. the government ' s ambition, set out in the tobacco control plan last year, is to reach 12 % or less by 2022, with a longer - term aim of achieving a 5 % prevalence rate. despite that relative success, the uk still has 7. 6 million smokers, which means that more than 200 people a day still die from smoking - related illnesses that could have been prevented, and that smoking is estimated to cost our economy in excess of a£11 billion a year. in 2017, local authorities cut their budgets for stop smoking services in half. separately, the number of smokers using nhs stop smoking services has decreased from a peak of 100, 000 in 2011 to 40, 000 in 2016. the bill aims to highlight what a package of measures could do to accelerate the decline in smoking prevalence. at the heart of this new approach is the creation of a new fund that would be used primarily to supplement local authorities ' cessation expenditure, while simultaneously encouraging cigarette companies to shift away from combustible products to less harmful alternatives. i know many are very wary of those products and the fact that many are produced or funded by tobacco companies. we must recognise that the tobacco companies have been extremely dishonest in the past about the harm caused by smoking."", ""it is a pleasure to take part in today ' s debate, and i welcome the one - year anniversary of the tobacco control policy for england. a great deal of progress has been made in reducing smoking prevalence across the uk. as has been pointed out, whereas in 1974 more than half of adult males and more than two in five women smoked, the latest figures from nhs digital suggest that smoking rates in the uk are now 15. 1 %. so i say congratulations on that achievement. the figures on smoking prevalence in scotland, where i come from, vary as between sources, but the office for national statistics has suggested a prevalence rate of 16. 3 % in 2017. since 2010, scotland has seen the largest decline in the proportion of smokers of the four uk jurisdictions, with a reduction of more than eight percentage points. that said, there are still about 10, 000 smoking - related deaths per year and 128, 000 smoking - related hospital admissions in scotland. the scottish government published their new five - year tobacco control plan in june. it goes a little further than the tobacco control plan for england, in that it not only puts forward a vision of a smoke - free generation but sets a date, 2034, by which we wish to achieve that vision. if scotland is to achieve its vision, it requires action by the westminster government on issues that are not devolved, such as tax, illicit trade and smoking in the entertainment media. page 14 of the tobacco control plan for scotland commits the scottish government toa€œcontinue to work with the uk government to address the representation of tobacco use in the media. a€that is not something that the scottish government can do on their own. a clear causal link has been established between exposure to smoking on screen in the entertainment media and smoking initiation in young people.""]"

the question is how it is done in a way that ensures that the police service operates correctly. it is not just politicians who say that - 35 % of btp officers and 45 % of btp staff in scotland say that they would probably leave the service if this integration went through. they have a great deal of pride in the service and safety that they provide to the public. before my nationalist colleagues jump up and say that i am talking the police service down, let me say that the entirety of the police service - btp and the police in my constituency - do a fantastic job in incredibly difficult circumstances. great damage is being done to police scotland because of the botched merger of all the police forces to create that body, not because of individual officers, who do as much as they possibly can on the ground with the slim pickings of resources they are given. to see how bad this integration would be, it is worth thinking about one of the basic grassroots issues - trains."", 'as an example, the scottish government say that they would take the 280 or so full - time equivalent btp officers in scotland and merge them into police scotland with its 17, 234 officers. that would not protect them, because if the officers within police scotland who wish to have a specialism in railway policing were first on the scene at a non - railway incident, they would be stuck with that incident right the way through. currently, if police scotland are the first on scene at the railways, they can transfer that to a btp officer when they arrive and vice versa. they could not do that. that is not protecting the current situation and the good work done by btp officers in scotland and across the country. my opposition and the strong opposition from scottish conservatives in westminster and holyrood must not be considered as disrespecting the smith commission and devolution settlement that followed. i agree that the functions of the british transport police in scotland should be a devolved matter - i just strongly disagree with the approach taken by the snp government. there were and are other options to devolve the powers, but we know that they were never considered by the scottish government. right from the start, the snp had a blinkered view on its approach - unwilling to listen to expert advice, which opposed its plans, and unwilling to listen to the views of btp officers, the british transport police federation, rail unions and rail operators. basically, everyone with considerable knowledge of railway policing warned the snp against the plans, but they were ignored and the snp marched on regardless. it only consulted on its preferred option : full integration with police scotland.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered proposals for the merger of british transport police scottish division with police scotland. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr hollobone. we had a slight wait for you to take the chair, but i know better than most that the match cannot start without a referee, so it is good to have you in your place. i thank the backbench business committee for allowing us time for this debate, as well as all right hon. and hon. members who supported the application - in particular, the hon. member for east lothian ( martin whitfield ), who joined me in front of that committee to present our case for the debate. i refer members to my declaration in the register of members ' financial interests. my wife is a serving police officer : a police sergeant with police scotland. i want to divide my remarks into three sections : the process from the smith commission to the vote in the scottish parliament approving the proposed merger ;

what about the huge number of existing meters that will be removed and need to be disposed of as smart meters are installed? those meters are not owned by installers but by meter asset providers that finance and ultimately own the meters that are put in. it has been a long - standing arrangement in the industry that meters are not owned by the suppliers but merely read by the suppliers. that means that when a programme is pursued of removing old meters, whether dumb meters or previous generation smart meters, there is a problem in identifying whose meters they are. the difficulty that we are facing right now - it is not a problem for the future - is that we might see meter mountains arising in this country because the people who are removing the meters do not know who their owners are or who is going to take them away and recycle and dispose of them. i do not want to see, as a result of this roll - out programme, meter mountains, or alps, appearing across the country.']"

i am sure if members were to open up their wallets and purses, they would have, if not one, then maybe two or three with them. there are 30 million cardholders in the united kingdom. indeed, the financial conduct authority has been investigating the credit card market.', ""my hon. friend is absolutely right. it is no surprise that she has done so much work on the link between debt and mental health issues. we are already seeing in the credit card industry the same patterns that we saw in the payday lending industry. if we are honest, we must admit that it took us too long, as a house, to act in respect of that industry. so many of us saw people in our constituency surgeries who were losing their homes and people who were massively in debt because they had become stuck in payday loans that they were using to pay for basics such as rent and food. but when we did act, what a difference it made. bringing in a cap on the cost of credit has led to an 86 % reduction in the number of people going to citizens advice bureaux with problems caused by payday lending. so one question for us is what the consequences will be if we do not act on credit card lenders. the minister may say to me that the credit card industry is completely different from the payday loan industry - that is what he said when we had an adjournment debate about this - so let me try to convince him that the two are intertwined. i see in my local community, as other members may have seen, companies such as vanquis, aqua and capital one - indeed, vanquis is owned by provident, which is a doorstep lending company - offering credit to people who have bad credit histories and driving them into the same level of debt as payday loans did. indeed, the fca ' s data shows exactly that, which is why it is such a mystery to me that it does not choose to learn the lessons from the payday lending industry and act accordingly. someone who has an aqua credit card with a monthly interest rate of 3.""]"

today it is 79 and 83 respectively. that is incredible. in 1948 there were more than 34 deaths for every 1, 000 live births ; today there are just five, although that is still too many. i will start where every health minister should, by thanking our nhs staff for all they do, day in, day out, to make our nhs something that we are incredibly proud of."", 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr hollobone, and i congratulate the hon. member for batley and spen ( tracy brabin ) on having secured this important debate. i have a little bit of a family connection to the nhs, as i am the daughter of a gp, but it is an honour to follow colleagues of all parties who have direct experience of working in the nhs. i welcome their having shared that experience with us. staffing levels in the nhs are an important issue, which affects my local nhs trust in worcestershire as well. i am in close contact with that trust and with staff at the alexandra hospital in redditch, and i very much hear that concern ;

what about the 2013 public accounts committee report into serco ' s running of gp out - of - hours care in cornwall, which accused the private company of bullying employees, providing a short - staffed and substandard service, and manipulating data to hide the truth? were patients receiving the best quality of care then? what about the imposition of financial penalties on the same company by nhs commissioners in suffolk in 2014, after it missed key targets in its community health services contract? in 2012 harmoni, a private provider of nhs out - of - hours gp services, having put in place an aggressive cost - cutting agenda, faced allegations from senior doctors that its service in london was so short - staffed that its patients were unsafe. i could recount many more examples of failed healthcare privatisation, but we do not have time. the government also claim that outsourcing allows the nhs to save money, but that is not necessarily true. the process by which private companies bid for contracts allows them effectively to cherry - pick the most profitable forms of treatment - usually low - risk elective surgeries. that allows the private sector to benefit from the predictable, and usually low, cost. that is far from providing the best quality of care for patients. why, then, do the government insist on continued nhs privatisation?"", ""i, too, want to use this opportunity to debunk the myth that the conservative party wants to, or ever has wanted to, privatise the nhs. that is an image that the labour party wants to portray, but the facts tell a different story. in the 70 years of the nhs, 43 of those years have been under a conservative government, so if privatising the nhs were the sole aim of the conservative party, it would have been done by now. the nhs remains based on the three founding principles of meeting the needs of everyone, being free at the point of use, and being based on clinical need, not ability to pay. however, facts do not often matter to the labour party. i was at a meeting at the weekend of more than 200 gps who were desperate for the politics to be taken out of the nhs. they welcome the government ' s talk of a long - term settlement and of taking the nhs out of the political cycle. that puts fear into the heart of labour because it would mean that the nhs would come first, not the motives of the labour party. if labour members were honest with themselves, they would recall the history of the last labour government, who did more for privatisation in the nhs than anyone before or since. in 1999, within two years of coming to power, the labour government set up market structures in the nhs to create choice and competition, with hospitals starting to charge by price per episode to compete with the private sector. that is labour ' s record on privatisation in the nhs. in 2003, they set up foundation trusts so that hospitals could be free from the constraints of the nhs and run like a business. that is labour ' s record of privatisation in the nhs. also in 2003, they introduced independent sector treatment centres - private companies set up to provide wholly nhs elective procedures.""]"

we think that it has been first class. it has been detailed and considered. anything that my hon. friends or i say today is in no way a criticism of the professional way in which the house staff have gone about their work. that includes the recent issuing of the client advisory services contracts not least to ensure that the building is safe for the thousands of staff and visitors who are here every single day, and to minimise the risk of catastrophic failure. as it is a house matter, it may well be that this house concludes that an expensive restoration of this royal palace, in whatever guise, is the right thing to do because some argue that this is the historic home of the uk parliament. if that is the decision, although i may not agree with it, i will certainly respect it. my criticism of the motions before us today and the amendment in the name of the hon. member for hackney south and shoreditch ( meg hillier ) is twofold. first, it is flawed that we are not even prepared to consider, on cost - effective grounds, the delivery of a new parliament on a new site. my second criticism is that we are prepared to proceed without taking this once in a 160 or 170 - year opportunity genuinely to modernise the way we work. on my first point, the leader of the house has outlined a delivery body to investigate the three options before us : a full decant, a partial decant, and a full decant while retaining a foothold. motion no. 2 clearly includes a cost - benefit analysis of each option.', ""this debate arguably should have taken place about 40 years ago, so i can say that i am delighted that here we are today, finally discussing the future of the palace of westminster. there are difficult decisions to make on how we best protect one of the world ' s most iconic buildings for future generations, but we must address those decisions head on. in any mention of this topic, i am sure the house would like to join me in first paying tribute to the excellent work done by the joint committee on the restoration and renewal of the palace of westminster, chaired by my right hon. friend the member for epsom and ewell ( chris grayling ) and the right hon. baroness stowell of beeston. a number of members of that committee are present in the chamber today, and the house owes them, along with the restoration and renewal programme team and our engineers, a debt of gratitude. their work, and that of our colleagues in the other place, has laid the foundations for the house to take an informed decision on this important issue. the palace of westminster is the seat of our democracy, an iconic, world - famous building - and it is in dire need of repair. both motions and all amendments on the order paper recognise the need for that work. anyone who has read the report of the joint committee will be aware of the two core difficulties we face. the first is one that none of us can shy away from : the costs associated with a programme of works of this magnitude will be significant. while it is our responsibility to safeguard this unesco world heritage site, it is equally our responsibility to ensure value for taxpayers ' money. we have been clear that there can be no blank cheque for this work, and value for taxpayers ' money will frame the choices we make today. the second issue is the state of disrepair within this building. the issue is not a structural one.""]"

to require banks to enable free cash withdrawals from current accounts in other circumstances ; to require the financial conduct authority to supervise an access to banking standard ; to impose penalties for breaches of that standard ; to establish a financial inclusion fund, and provide for amounts received in such penalties to be paid into that fund ; and for connected purposes. recently link, which set the funding formula for atm operators, consulted its members on proposals to reduce from 25p to 20p the interchange fee paid to atm operators by banks when cash is withdrawn. the first phase of the cut will take place on 1 july 2018. this proposed reduction in the funding formula has led to concerns that many atms will become financially unviable and therefore may be forced to close or charge a fee to remain in use. the bill seeks to remove the option for atms to become fee - charging by banning fees. i take this position, first and foremost, out of principle, as i do not believe that anyone should have to pay to access their own money. however, a ban on atm charges makes it a practical necessity that an appropriate funding formula for free - to - use atms be devised. in supporting this objective, the bill seeks to provide a legal requirement for access to cash withdrawals through atms or other means where there is a demand for it. such demand would be established through a full market review of the atm network by the payment systems regulator. there has been no recent review of the demand for access to cash, and as we transition towards a cashless society it is important that we fully and comprehensively establish where demand remains for cash in order to target resources effectively.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the effect of atm closures on towns, high streets and rural communities. it is a pleasure to see you in the chair, mr hollobone. i and other hon. members on both sides of the house have been raising the closure of atms and its impact on our towns, high streets and rural communities for some time. the issue is more pressing than ever. in november 2017, link, the atm membership body that sets the funding for free - to - use atms, began consulting on proposed cuts to the funding mechanism known as the interchange rate fee - a fee paid to the atm operator, by the bank or company that issues a consumer ' s bank card, when cash is withdrawn. prior to link ' s reductions, that fee was 25p. in its consultation, link proposed reducing the fee to 20p through four rounds of cuts beginning on 1 july this year and ending in january 2021, although the third cut was cancelled and the fourth has been put under review. from the beginning, link accepted that those changes would lead to atm closures. in its analysis and consultation documents, it stated that it expected a decline of between 1 % and 11 % in free - to - use atms, but that it was confident that there would be a reduction only in areas with a high concentration of free - to - use atms, such as cities. however, the number of closures has been far higher - approximately 250 per month - since link announced its consultation. operators such as note machine and cardtronics say they expect to lose thousands of machines each, and new installations have been put on hold.""]"

overall, the co2 emissions of a diesel car tend to be lower, diesel fuel contains more energy per litre than petrol and diesel engines are more efficient than petrol engines, especially in rural environments. modern euro 6 diesel cars are the cleanest in history : they capture 99 % of particulates and emit 84 % fewer nox emissions than in 2000. so, we know that new diesels do not compare to the older ones. we also know from data from the society of motor manufacturers and traders that average co2 emissions from cars sold in 2017 were higher than in 2016, reversing a near 20 - year decline. they blame that increase on the demonisation of diesel since 2015, which means that we cannot take for granted the progress made in reducing co2 emissions since 2000. we are heading in the wrong direction, as diesel sales have fallen by 37 % since last year. mike hawes, smmt chief executive, criticised the autumn budget, which increased taxes on sales of new diesels. he commented that people were concerned about these tax increases and werea€œholding off buying new diesel cars because of the confusion and that means older, dirtier diesels are staying on the roads. a€that is precisely the point made by the hon. member for solihull ( julian knight ). nick molden, chief executive of testing company emissions analytics, agreed that, rather than impose higher taxes on new cars, the oldest cars and dirtiest diesel cars should be targeted instead.', ""as has been mentioned, this sector has been one of britain ' s greatest manufacturing success stories, providing thousands of jobs and a major contribution to our country ' s economic growth. the story of my own constituency ' s past cannot be told without an understanding of the sector, dominated by ford ' s dagenham plant, which at its height employed some 40, 000 workers. today, dagenham ' s two engine plants produce 1 million diesel engines annually - 50 % of ford ' s global diesel requirement - and provide over 3, 000 jobs. some 89 % of those engines are exported. the total turnover stands at a£1. 75 billion. however, investment in britain ' s car industry has halved during the past two years. brexit concerns and the demonization of diesel appear to be the two biggest challenges. the crisis of confidence in diesel vehicles and diesel technology was triggered by volkswagen ' s emissions scandal, but the upshot has been damage to not just vw but the whole sector. i am not seeking to defend older diesel engines, which, in truth, are more polluting than their petrol counterparts. however, we must bring some nuance back into the debate. all diesel technology is being tarred with the same brush, despite the fact that state - of - the - art diesel technology is a vast improvement over its predecessors. as has been mentioned, those dirtier engines will, ironically, be kept on the road longer if consumers are misinformed about the difference between diesel technologies. it is clean - diesel technology that is being invested in in dagenham. ford invested a£490 million in developing clean, cutting - edge diesel technology in dagenham in 2014. this new generation of clean engines meets the euro 6 emissions standards and satisfies transport for london ' s ultra - low emission zone."", ""that shows the cross - party agreement on some of the points i am making today. the trouble is that in the uk, germany, france and spain - the markets where anti - diesel rhetoric is highest - diesel consumption is declining fastest. sales of diesel cars have slumped as regulators and politicians announce plans for bans, levies and additional taxes in many cities. in truth, we in dagenham fear that diesel has become a bit of a political football. in 2001, gordon brown introduced a new system of car tax aimed at protecting the environment - a sliding scale to make it cheaper for cars with lower co2 emissions. that helped stimulate a dash for diesel after its introduction in 2001 and its extension in subsequent years. there are now some 12 million diesel cars on british roads, while back in 2000 there were only 3 million. in recent years, diesel has accounted for around half of the new car market. in 2000, by comparison, only one in seven new cars was a diesel model, yet following a 2017 bbc report on the dangers of diesel, the environment secretary jumped into the debate to make political capital : a€œthe dash for diesel was pursued under a labour government... this is yet another example of a conservative government having to clean up labour ' s mess... we are taking action... ending the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040. a€political game playing should have no role, given the challenges facing the sector, as reflected in the comments made by colleagues across the house today. since the 2015 vw revelations, cities have taken the lead over national governments.""]"

governing and autonomous, and most of which operate under separate royal charters."", ""i believe that nothing is more important than to make the hon. gentleman ' s life easier, so i am pleased to broadly confirm - i hope - exactly what he is saying. there is a fundamental lack of clarity internationally. many people in this country understand the importance of the university of london ' s member institutes, which have fantastic reputations. however, particularly in the global marketplace for education, there is, as he describes, a lack of clarity about the overarching university of london structure and the institutes that are, in some cases, called colleges and schools. i went to the london school of economics and some people will not understand the difference between that and a university, so the hon. gentleman is completely right, as i will confirm even further as i work through my remarks. the member institutes set their own academic criteria and in most cases have their own degree - awarding powers. in addition to the london business school in my constituency, the colleges include university college london - called somewhat confusingly both a university and a college - king ' s college, the london school of economics, birkbeck and the newest arrival, city university, which joined the federation only in 2016. imperial college, on the other hand, left the federation in 2007, having no other option at the time for it to achieve university status. the university of london provides a range of opt - in central services to its member institutions, including the university library at senate house, in which i spent many happy hours, the careers service and collaboration with the university on its international academy programme, which provides distance learning to over 50, 000 students worldwide. members pay an annual subscription to the university and terms of federation membership are prescribed in the university ' s statutes. the key rationale for the bill, as i said in response to interventions, is that it will facilitate the university ' s member institutions becoming universities in their own right."", ""last year, the government passed the higher education and research act 2017 with the aim of opening up the higher education market. the act enables high - quality providers of higher education to gain degree - awarding powers more quickly, and also allows those with an excellent track record to achieve university titles. i recognise, however, that existing legislation poses problems for the colleges in the university of london federation. under the current rules, colleges that wish to obtain university titles will have to leave the federation altogether, which could undermine both its provision and its reputation. if, however, colleges remain under the current arrangement, their lack of university title may also undermine their prestige and standing, which could have an adverse effect on their ability to recruit students, particularly those from overseas. i therefore fully support this private bill, which seeks to correct technicalities in existing legislation and allow the colleges of the university of london to become universities in their own right, while remaining part of the university ' s federal structure.""]"

i mean, england 2. it is a pleasure to be in the house, and we are very grateful to snp members for enabling us to watch the match. i rise to speak to the motion in the name of my right hon. friend the prime minister. i pay tribute to the hon. member for rhondda ( chris bryant ) and my right hon. friend the member for south holland and the deepings ( mr hayes ) for their persistence at business questions and elsewhere, and for securing this debate in the house. brain injury awareness week took place last month, which makes today ' s debate especially timely. let me first recognise the important work of organisations such as headway and the united kingdom acquired brain injury forum in raising awareness and in providing information and support to those living with acquired brain injury and to their friends, families and carers. i know that some of them are with us this evening, and i thank them for their persistence during the family dispute we have had in the chamber for the past three hours. acquired brain injury - abi - is an injury that takes place after birth in an otherwise healthy brain. it includes traumatic brain injuries such as those caused by road traffic accidents, falls or assaults, and non - traumatic brain injuries related to illnesses or medical conditions, including meningitis, stroke or brain tumours. while prevalence estimates for abi are quite hard to make, the number living with it is thought to be over 500, 000 and could be as high as 1 million people.""]"

informed debate, and i am grateful to the right hon. member for arundel and south downs for his tremendous summary and history of the issue. i have a bit more history for the house. first, though, i would like to give the scottish picture. tb levels in scotland are relatively stable and low. it accounts for between eight and nine cases per 100, 000 of the population and is a contributing factor in about 40 deaths a year - although any death is a death too many. archaeological records show signs of tuberculosis in the remains of ancient mummies, and on this very day 689 years ago, robert the bruce, king of scots, is alleged to have died of tuberculosis. tb has killed more people than any other disease in history. the modern scottish government are playing their part in tackling global challenges, including epidemics and health inequalities. since 2005, the scottish government have committed at least a£3 million a year towards funding international development work. this was initially focused on malawi to reflect 150 years of collaborative development between our two countries. in 2017, that was increased to a£10 million a year. tb is a major public health problem in malawi, and multi -

it does not apply to the other sites under hes contractual arrangements with the trust. the hon. gentleman asked whether the waste was being secured safely. the answer is yes ; the environment agency has been inspecting the situation. the issue is the overstorage of waste, not that the waste is not being stored in a safe manner. well, that is the legal remit of the environment agency, which is an independent body.', ""as i set out in the written statement published this morning, on 31 july the environment agency notified central government of an issue concerning clinical waste disposal. the primary concern was that too much waste was being held by a contractor, healthcare environment services, in a number of waste storage and treatment sites. this included waste collected from hospitals and other public services. although the waste was stored securely, it was not being disposed of within the correct regulatory timescales. the department of health and social care, the nhs, the department for environment, food and rural affairs, the environment agency and the cabinet office have worked together to resolve the issues. our priority throughout has been to ensure that proper measures were put in place to enable trusts to continue to operate as normal. a major part of the contingency plans concerned commercially sensitive contractual discussions with hes and other providers. following the environment agency ' s partial suspension of hes ' s normanton site, which came into force on 3 october 2018, nhs improvement wrote to hes to raise its concerns. nhsi gave hes an opportunity to set out how it was complying with its legal and contractual obligations ; hes failed to provide that assurance. as a result, 15 nhs trusts served contract termination notices on sunday 7 october. as part of our contingency arrangements, we ran a tender process with the clinical waste sector before awarding a new contract to mitie. as contracts with hes were terminated over the weekend, mitie stepped in and, from monday morning, provided continuing waste collection and incineration across all of these organisations. in september, officials from the department of health and social care visited each of the major trauma centres affected and confirmed that waste was being stored correctly and that contingency plans were in place. in addition, visits have been undertaken to each of the sites by the environment agency this weekend and this week, alongside earlier visits.""]"

the rationale for excluding flour from fortification is unclear. there is clearly strong support for that among members of the medical profession."", ""it is a pleasure to be here under your chairmanship, mr hanson. i congratulate the hon. member for pontypridd ( owen smith ) on securing this important debate and on the eloquent and cogent way that he set out the case for the fortification of flour with folic acid. when the facts are set out and the evidence is adduced, it is a very compelling case. it is all the more surprising, when one hears the weighted evidence of the arguments in favour of it, that something has not yet been done in this country to ensure the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid. the hon. gentleman said that that has happened in many major countries across the world with vast populations. he mentioned brazil, the united states and canada ; they are big countries with very strong regulatory regimes in which this practice has been carried out. therefore, there have been multiple opportunities to have all the scientific evidence evaluated and to have all the upsides and downsides considered. it is very clear that the upsides are so massive that they require this country to follow suit. it is a shame that we are not yet in a position in this country to have mandatory fortification of flour. it has been 27 years since the medical research council published its research demonstrating that supplementing women ' s diets with folic acid before the early stages of pregnancy reduced the chances of the pregnancy being affected by neural tube defects. that was in 1991. it was in 1990 that my son, andrew, was born with spina bifida. very soon after he was born, we became experts in the whole area of spina bifida : the reasons for it, how it develops and all the rest of it.""]"

it is about having a secure and reliable passport system that works for the uk. there must be questions about how gemalto can make a contract worth a£390 million work. in fact, i understand that the bid from de la rue was significantly less than the previous price, and that it operates a gain - share agreement whereby any excess profits are returned to the home office."", ""her majesty ' s passport office is currently procuring services to design, manufacture and personalise uk passports from summer 2019, when the current contract ends. hm passport office has undertaken a rigorous, fair and open competition in accordance with uk law, and in line with eu and world trade organisation rules. this process began in march 2017, at which point hm passport office clearly set out the requirements under which potential suppliers should table their bids. the security of the passport and passport holders ' personal data is paramount, and the tender requirements clearly set out the high standard of security that must be met to undertake the contract. for example, under the next contract, all passports will continue to be personalised with the holder ' s personal details in the united kingdom, which ensures that no personal data will leave the uk. however, the printing of blank passports in the uk is not a new requirement. robust processes that have been established over a number of years have determined that manufacturing passports overseas presents no security concerns. under the current contract, up to 20 % of blank passports are produced in europe. there is no reason why overseas production should not continue in the future and, as such, a national security waiver could not apply. while there are no security or operational impediments to outsourcing the production of passports, there are significant benefits in terms of both value for money, and production innovation and development. this procurement has identified the supplier that best meets the needs of our passport service - keeping the uk passport at the forefront of travel document security, while offering the best value for money. i am unable to confirm any details of the bids while the process remains subject to commercial and legal sensitivities. however, a public announcement to confirm the winning bidder will be made once the contract is formally awarded.""]"

the justice against sponsors of terrorism act. it will be interesting to hear what the minister says about that. we then heard from my hon. friend the member for jarrow ( mr hepburn ), who has been a member of the northern ireland affairs committee since 2004. he said that we must never forget the victims over so many years who are still suffering today. that was generally the theme of this debate.', 'no, i did not raise that at this time. our position on the frozen assets is known, but let me come back to that in a moment. if i may, i will make a little progress so that i can present some conclusions. one or two colleagues raised the issue of visibility, which the foreign secretary has previously raised with the prime minister of libya. as far as visibility is concerned, we will continue to raise the matter at the highest level with libyan counterparts. however, i must say that my conclusion from such meetings and from meeting ministers myself is that i just do not think they are in a position to deal with this or to put forward anything at present. i am not sure that we can put any timescale on this process, which means that we may have to think about it differently. progress is likely to continue to be difficult and slow until the situation in libya changes significantly for the better. hon. members have raised the question of libyan assets. i do not want to take too much time, but i must repeat that the advice i have been given is that there is no lawful basis on which the uk could seize or change the ownership of any libyan assets, whether they are owned by the gaddafi family or by the libyan state. the un security council resolution under which these assets were frozen is clear that they should eventually be returned for the benefit of the libyan people, and to breach the resolution would be a violation of international law. we set out our position on several of the issues that have been mentioned in the government response to the northern ireland affairs committee report last year, and in substance the position has not changed, but let me look towards the future. the government will continue to help victims engage directly with the libyan authorities in order to pursue their campaign for compensation. the foreign secretary and i have previously met victims groups and the hon.']"

the aspect of fees that i personally have greatest difficulty with is the profit that the home office makes on the applications. of the a£1, 012 that is charged, a£372 is the cost of administration and almost two thirds is profit. the free movement website estimates that the home office has made nearly a£100 million in profits over the past five years.', 'if the hon. gentleman allows me to make some progress, i will turn to the points he made in his opening speech. during 2017 - 18, about 64, 000 people were granted indefinite leave to remain and 123, 000 were granted citizenship. of those granted citizenship, more than 28, 000 were minor children who were registered and were related to a british citizen, or children granted citizenship on a discretionary basis. in all cases the applicants either paid the due fee or had that fee paid on their behalf, reflecting the value placed on permanent residence and citizenship in the uk. the charging framework for visa and immigration services delivered a£1. 35 billion of income in the last financial year, 2017 - 18. that helped to fund more than a£620 million of costs associated with other immigration system functions, helping to maintain their effectiveness and security, and investment in ongoing service improvement. setting fees at above the cost of processing an application has also helped us to set some fees at below cost - for example, short - term visit visas, in recognition of the significant economic benefits that tourists and other visitors bring to the whole of the uk. the subsidy for the circa 2. 5 million short - term visit visas issued each year costs in the region of a£90 million per annum, which can be afforded only by setting a wide range of other fees. let me make one other obvious point : setting fees at the level that we do - putting the burden on those who benefit from the services - reduces the burden on the exchequer and on the general taxpayers of this country. it is easy, particularly in opposition, to call for fees or taxes to be reduced, but a responsible government must balance the books. the loss of income that would result from any reduction in fees would have to be made up elsewhere, and there have been rather fewer suggestions of how that might be achieved.']"

a new special jurisdiction, courts and a truth commissioner ; political participation by the farc as a legal political party with seats in the congress and the house of representatives ; land reform, which my hon. friend the member for rhondda talked about ;

the question is the extent to which they can be tailored or lifted to suit appropriate local circumstances. first, however, let me say something about accessibility issues. our london taxis have a fantastic record : all 21, 000 are wheelchair - accessible, but the story is not the same across the country. i am told that in metropolitan areas outside london, 83 % of taxis are wheelchair - accessible, but in some rural areas the figure falls as low as 15 %. one of the challenges that we face is making our taxi and private hire fleet more accessible to people throughout the country. there is a lot of variation in the approach to disability awareness training, which only 41 % of local authorities require for taxi drivers and only 38 % require for private hire vehicle drivers. over the past few years, the percentage of local authorities that require taxi and private hire vehicle drivers to complete training on the subject of child sexual abuse or exploitation has risen to 70 %, partly in response to some very sad incidents in some parts of the country. however, that leaves nearly 100 licensing authorities that still do not require drivers to undertake such training. i became interested in the subject when i had the privilege of serving as a shadow transport minister for a couple of years. when i later had the opportunity to introduce a private member ' s bill, i chose to try to do something about safety issues, on which there is cross - party consensus. since i introduced my bill - the licensing of taxis and private hire vehicles ( safeguarding and road safety ) bill - some 18 months ago, i have had the opportunity to discuss the issue with enforcement officers and officials from knowsley to london and with taxi and private hire firms from brighton to manchester.""]"

up cities, we are blessed with parks and pockets of green space. those spaces improve air quality, lower temperatures near congested cities and even harbour wildlife, but they are also the lifeblood of our communities. as we face an obesity crisis and concerns over public health, parks offer free and accessible opportunities for exercise and enjoyment. at a time when families are living in ever more cramped conditions and unsuitable housing, parks provide a much - needed environment in which children without access to other opportunities can enjoy being children. in an era of extreme loneliness and isolation, they are bringing people of all ages together, and in an age of unprecedented privatisation and commercialisation of public space, they remain free for everyone to use and benefit from. according to the indices of multiple deprivation, my constituency is one of the most deprived in the country. government figures suggest that we might expect to see far fewer parks and open spaces in such areas than in wealthier areas. however, sheffield, brightside and hillsborough, despite its legacy as a highly urban formerly industrial area, is an exception to this, having substantial areas of parks and open space across the constituency. sheffield can lay claim to being the greenest city in europe, with a third of our city boundary lying within the peak district and a history of prestigious prizes won, including the 2005 entente florale gold medal. we are blessed with hundreds of parks and open spaces, and residents have access to a huge range of facilities, from small play parks to ancient woodlands. the national trust funded research in 2016 on sheffield ' s parks, which highlighted the huge value and benefit they hold for local people and the financial value that they represent to health and other public services."", 'i absolutely agree. that is the thrust of my speech tonight, and i have already detailed the effects of cuts to budgets for policing and public services. it would be easy to ask the minister to consider making parks statutory services, so that councils could be held to account more easily for their maintenance. however, my local parks would not be helped one bit by that without the government backing up the change with serious funding for local authorities to meet this requirement. labour and the conservatives have different views about local authority funding, and i do not think that we will resolve this difference tonight. as much as local authorities can innovate in developing and maintaining parks, it appears to be an unfortunate truth that there will always be higher costs. i ask the minister specifically to ensure that councils have enough capital funds to create parks that are resilient to the challenges they can face. i also ask him to work with the minister for sport to ensure that lottery funds specifically support parks facing difficulties with misuse and the lack of commercial income that i have outlined. as welcome as the a€œparks for peoplea€ programme was, its focus on heritage meant that parks in the most challenging areas sometimes lost out in favour of parks in traditionally leafier suburbs. i thank members and the minister for attending tonight. i also thank local people, interested organisations and local parks officers who all offered a wealth of information, so much of which i could not touch on tonight. i hope that i can make a small contribution to ensuring that we have resilient parks and green spaces in every part of my constituency and in every city. maintaining and improving parks for every citizen is an absolute necessity if we want to create a more equal, healthy and happy society.']"

petition 200585 relating to childcare vouchers. i am pleased to serve under your chairmanship, mr bailey, and to lead this debate as a member of the petitions committee. i must also declare an interest as a beneficiary of the childcare vouchers scheme. the e - petition, entitled a€œkeep childcare vouchers open beyond april 2018a€, was signed by more than 116, 000 people, including almost 400 across my own city. it reads : a€œhundreds of thousands of parents will lose out under the new tax - free childcare. the voucher schemes should be kept open alongside tax - free childcare to give parents a genuine choice for the support that best suits their family. a€the creator of the e - petition, ellie symonds - lloyd, is in the gallery with her family. i am particularly pleased to be leading this debate, given the importance of the wider issue to our society and to the economy as a whole. increasing the availability of affordable childcare, particularly for younger children, is one of the key issues for many of britain ' s families, with a huge impact on their standard of living. as the joseph rowntree foundation highlighted after the publication of the 2017 childcare survey by the family and childcare trust last march : a€œthe biggest cost for many working households with children, after housing, is childcare. the cost of all types of childcare has risen much faster than overall inflation. the cost of childcare can affect the real increase in disposable income gained by a parent taking a job or working for more hours. this can affect families ' living standards directly and also indirectly by influencing whether parents work at all, what jobs they take and how much they work."", 'it would be helpful if hon. members did not just make up statistics and facts as they went along, as we just heard from the hon. lady. hon. members should listen to us regarding the support that we are now providing to claimants. as i said, it is a topsy - turvy world. there was a ding - dong when the opposition were calling for the changes. now that we are introducing the changes, we are back to another ding - dong and they do not want the changes - but never mind. i turn to the regulations concerning national insurance contributions and childcare. these regulations align the tax and national insurance treatment of employer - supported childcare, where parents opt into the new tax - free childcare scheme. they remove the national insurance disregard to new entrants to the scheme, once the relevant day has been set. they are vital to ensure that the tax system operates fairly and consistently and that the government can target their childcare support effectively. for many parents, being able to afford good - quality childcare is essential for them to work and support their families. that is why we are replacing the childcare vouchers with tax - free childcare, which is a fairer and better - targeted system. tax - free childcare is now open to all eligible parents, who can get up to a£2, 000 per child per year to help towards their childcare costs. more families will be able to access support through tax - free childcare because only about half of employed working parents can access vouchers, and self - employed parents were excluded from vouchers. therefore, 1. 5 million families are now eligible for tax - free childcare compared with about 600, 000 families currently benefiting from vouchers.', ""let me make my introductory remarks, and then i will give way. let me draw members ' attention to the three key reasons why we support the replacement of childcare vouchers with tax - free childcare. first, the government believe that childcare vouchers are unfair. tax - free childcare is fairer and better targeted than the voucher scheme. for example, only about 5 % of employers offer vouchers, which limits their reach to about half of working parents, not to mention that self - employed parents are completely excluded from the scheme, which pays no regard to the number of children in each family and disadvantages lone - parent families. secondly, tax - free childcare has a broader reach. it is open to all working families with children aged under 12 that meet the earnings criteria. that ensures that families who were excluded from childcare vouchers can be brought into tax - free childcare, and benefits families with the highest childcare costs - namely, most of those with young children. thirdly, tax - free childcare is simpler to use - i will come to the it issues that members raised. employers usually pay third - party providers to administer childcare voucher schemes. the government do not believe that paying third - party providers is a good use of taxpayers ' money. some a£220 million has gone on such administration since the scheme began. a voucher scheme is therefore an ineffective way of delivering support to families. under tax - free childcare, parents manage their own accounts online. the case for change is clear, as it was to the labour party when it announced at its 2009 conference, when it was in government, that the existing system would be shut down. i will now happily give way to the hon. lady.""]"

only a small number live in that very important community - and convincing him to leave because the back windows had dirt coming in and he was at risk of being crushed if he stayed in his own home. as the hon. member for angus mentioned, there are challenges in dealing with insurance companies. there is no doubt that we have significant challenges in coastal erosion the length and breadth of scotland and beyond, and it is vital that all the governments of the uk work together. i want to set the record straight on what the scottish government have done. i hope the hon. lady will be aware of the a£42 million a year that the scottish government have made available via the capital settlement since 2008 - that is, a£420 million - to enable local authorities to invest in flood prevention and coastal erosion works.', 'i thank my hon. friend for his intervention and i absolutely agree. there are huge studies going on in my constituency as well, because we need to do the groundwork, but we also need to have the funding ready for when those studies complete, so that we can go ahead with the work that needs to be done. of course, when it comes to coastal erosion, the waves do not respect local authority boundaries. erosion affects areas up and down the coastline and different local authorities face common and related problems. this is not something that should be left to local authorities alone ; there is space for a much more joined - up approach to erosion at all levels of government. however, such action must also be timely. i do not want to see montrose ending up as a cautionary tale for other parts of the coastline. unfortunately, the scottish government are risking that happening by leaving the implementation of further solutions to the 2022 to 2028 six - year plan for flood risk management. angus cannot wait until 2022, or until any time between 2022 and 2028. even by 2022, swathes of the angus coastline will have been lost. the risk of flooding and erosion to montrose, arbroath and other coastal communities in angus will be even more serious than it is today, and existing defences are being put under increasing and unbearable strain. it is the responsibility of local authorities, the devolved administrations and the uk government alike to start working together on the issue as a matter of urgency, so that we can quite literally hold back the tide that threatens so many of our coastal communities. the government are due to publish their updated national flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy next year, and within that i ask the minister to consider ways to make that work happen, ensuring that everyone involved in protecting our coasts around the whole uk is working effectively together.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered coastal erosion. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir david. the future of britain ' s coastline, and of our coastal communities, is finally getting the political attention that it deserves - not a moment too soon. from the need to curb plastic waste to prevent environmental damage to our shores to the opportunities that brexit presents for reviving our long - struggling fishing communities, britain ' s coasts are coming to the forefront of the political agenda. i am glad, because if our coastal communities are to benefit from this renewed focus on their future, we need to act now to ensure that they have a future. coastal erosion threatens large parts of britain ' s coasts and puts houses, businesses and entire communities at risk of flooding or, in some cases, total destruction. many hon. members will be familiar with this issue, as coastal erosion threatens about 17 % of the uk ' s coastline, specifically along the east coast. the environment agency estimates that more than 700 properties in england could be lost to coastal erosion by the 2030s, while in scotland, erosion is believed to pose a risk to a fifth of the coastline and the erosion rate has doubled since the 1970s. in 2013 and 2014, storms and extreme tides caused erosion that experts believed would never happen, but it has happened, and even quicker than they thought as it occurred almost overnight. businesses and individuals are increasingly concerned about the impact of the increasingly rapid degradation of our coastline. our coasts are vital areas and hubs of economic activity. as well as the obvious tourism draws, they are home to much of our crucial infrastructure. in scotland, the soft coastline, which is about 19 % of the total, and which is most at risk, includes roads, railways and scotland ' s water network.""]"

case scenario. that reflects the very challenging operating environment in eastern drc, which is a heavily populated area affected by insecurity. for example, last weekend an attack by armed groups on a monusco base was close to where a vaccination team were staying. thankfully, none of the ebola responders was injured, but they were moved to goma for a short period and vaccination activities had to be paused for a day. the scale of the response is also challenging. in addition to the 373 confirmed and probable cases, the drc government, supported by who and other implementing partners, is trying to trace some 4, 400 contacts on a daily basis. however, there is some encouraging news. the response is enabling faster detection of cases, laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of the spread of the disease.', ""first, i thank the minister for giving me advance sight of her statement. i share the government ' s deep concern about the outbreak of ebola in the democratic republic of the congo, and i am pleased to hear that a£25 million of uk aid has been given to the response. we hope that it goes some way to containing this deadly outbreak. in addition, supporting neighbouring countries to prepare to tackle the disease is fundamental and welcome. in 2014, we learned the hard way what happens when action is not taken fast enough to halt the cruel and deadly ebola virus. we all remember with great sadness how too many people tragically lost their lives in west africa, and none of us will ever forget the fear and chaos that the virus wreaked on the affected communities, and indeed right across the globe. i am sure we all agree that we must act now to avoid a repeat of those horrific scenes, and help the drc to contain this outbreak. with the world health organisation reporting that 213 people have died since 1 august in the drc, and the humanitarian agency ma©decins sans frontia¨res confirming 366 cases, let us be sure that dfid steps up and ensures that the uk plays a crucial leadership role alongside the international community in responding to this outbreak, just as we did in sierra leone four years ago. however, while emergency humanitarian response is an integral part of dfid ' s work, i am sure the minister agrees that prevention is better than emergency response. while we send aid to drc, we cannot and must not turn our backs on providing the long - term support that will ensure countries across the global south have appropriate health systems set up in the first place. it is deeply disappointing, therefore, that the minister ' s department dropped health spending from 18 % of dfid spend in 2014, to 12 % in 2017."", 'i will come on to the lessons learnt since the outbreak in sierra leone in a moment. however, i am sure that i cannot possibly have heard from the opposition front bench a statement to the effect that having a strong private sector is somehow in conflict with having the revenues needed to provide strong health systems around the world. i hope that that is not the considered position of those on the labour front bench. while spending on strengthening health systems around the world, particularly in some of the poorest and most fragile affected countries, it is important that we in the uk recognise the important role of growth and job creation in the ability of those countries to generate their own tax revenues so that they can continue to strengthen their own health systems. we think that that is the most important way to approach worldwide development. i digress from the topic at hand. the hon. lady mentions the outbreak in west africa. i draw the attention of the house to progress and lessons that have been learned since that outbreak. first, the importance of reacting quickly has been taken into account, both in the first outbreak in the drc earlier this year, which i am glad to say has been brought under control, and in this outbreak. importantly, the uk has ensured that the who has the resources it needs as soon as it needs them, because this is a clear case of where a quick reaction will save lives. one major milestone that has occurred since the outbreak in west africa is that the world has developed an experimental vaccine, which was deployed for the first time this year in the drc. it proved to be effective in the first outbreak. as i said, 31, 000 people have been given the experimental vaccine so far in this outbreak. one real challenge, however, is that this outbreak is in a conflict - affected area.']"

we need that to be sorted. there is evidence that for a significant proportion of people with pku - about 25 % - this drug can significantly improve their condition. it does not cure it, but it does make it much easier to deal with the dietary issues, which have such an impact on the way people live their lives. despite the drug having been around for so long, nhs england has only recently considered it for the management of pku. the drug has now been referred to nice for assessment and technology appraisal. the appg on pku recently heard from nice about the process, but there is concern about the timescales and how the benefits of the treatment will be assessed. understandably, there is huge frustration on the part of the pku community that there are children and adults who could be benefiting from kuvan now, and there is substantial evidence to support its benefits. there is a particular issue about prescribing kuvan for pregnant women with pku, who can understandably find it hugely difficult to control their diet, and who fear the effect of any problems on their unborn child. while there is a 2013 commissioning policy in place that allows kuvan to be prescribed to some pregnant women, it can be difficult for women to be prescribed it in a timely way. some people, some of whom are in this room, have had access to kuvan through individual funding requests, or on a trial basis. those people have found real benefits from the drug. my constituent archie, who is here, started on the treatment earlier this year.', 'like other hon. members, i wanted to speak in the debate because pku affects a family in my constituency. i will not go over what pku or kuvan are. the hon. member for blaydon ( liz twist ) did an excellent job of that, and i congratulate her on her work as chair of the appg in bringing this issue to wider attention across the house. scotland has a higher prevalence of pku than other parts of the uk, which makes the attitude of the scottish medicines consortium so disappointing. it has a poor record of approving treatments for very rare diseases, and i understand from conversations with the nspku that the current application for pku is not going particularly well. the decision is due next week on 3 july, and there is real concern that it will not be approved, even for high - risk groups such as pregnant women. the hon. member for blaydon mentioned that there is currently a pretty poor kuvan policy for pregnant women in england. it may be poor, but at least it is a policy ; we do not even have that north of the border. pregnancies for women with pku are extremely high risk. we have a slightly odd fail - first approach in this country, which can lead to serious defects and lifelong disabilities for children if they survive the pregnancy. the cost to the nhs of treating those disabilities over the life of the child is significantly more than the cost of kuvan for the mother during pregnancy. we have an odd approach to cost - effectiveness when looking at medicines in this country that i think we need to reassess. that is not only true for kuvan ;

party parliamentary china group, i congratulate others for joining in the debate and for expressing our concern about human rights, democracy and individual freedoms. as we reflect on the past 20 years, it is important to pay tribute to the hong kong government for the significant steps forward they have taken since handover, from minimum wage legislation to anti - corruption drives, clean water initiatives and huge investments in public infrastructure projects. as we look forward to the next 20 years, we should pause to remember the past 20, and how important the principles of the joint declaration are for the flourishing of hong kong ' s economy and society. the dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit of the hong kong people has allowed hong kong to flourish under the joint declaration. there is no reason why that should not continue. the uk - hong kong relationship has deepened. more than 600 uk businesses with registered offices in hong kong, an export market worth a£8. 6 billion and a uk investment stake of more than a£33 billion are clear signs that trade is booming. in terms of academic and cultural exchange, more hong kong students are enrolling at uk universities than ever before, which is an achievement to celebrate. in part, the relationships we form with students, young people and young democrats redouble our efforts to commit ourselves to a more socially just society based on individual freedoms and human rights. we are all aware of the high -

related murder of our late colleague in the labour party, jo cox, and between march and september 2017, there were a further five terrorist outrages, at westminster, on 22 march, at manchester arena, on 22 may, at london bridge, on 3 june, at finsbury park, on 19 june, and at parsons green, on 15 september - although, mercifully, no one was killed in that final attack. it is fundamental that our approach in legislation does not undermine the very values that the terrorists seek to attack. the rule of law has to be fundamental to our approach. i am grateful for the consensual approach that the security minister has taken on the bill and the concessions he has made. the concession in respect of the three clicks in clause 3 makes it a better bill. the concession on clause 14 and the preservation of the right to peaceful protest is very important, too, and is very much a part of what he rightly said about protecting our own values as an open, liberal and tolerant democracy. i hope that this consensual approach can now continue into the lords. as i indicated in my speech on the first set of new clauses and amendments, i am concerned that the designated areas clause came so late, and we will therefore want to subject it to scrutiny.', 'i come to this debate wanting to be positive about attempts by the government to give our police and security forces the powers that they need in the fight against terrorism and to balance that with the equal priority of ensuring that we do not hit our civil liberties and therefore give the terrorists a victory. already we have heard how different aspects of this bill will be judged by those tests. no one who witnessed the horrors in london and manchester last year can be in any doubt that we need to redouble our efforts to protect the public. the evidence is clear, and the terrorist threat across the uk remains severe. with that threat morphing into a diverse range of threats, including people acting alone, and with the numbers involved increasing, if anything, the terrorist threat for our security forces and the police is probably the most difficult it has ever been. liberal democrats will not, at this early stage, seek to oppose this bill, but ministers and those watching this debate should not take that as agreement, in full or in part, to these proposed laws. we need to scrutinise the bill to make sure that we get the balance right. it is already clear from this debate that there are serious questions whether some of these proposed laws are necessary, whether they are properly based on sound evidence and whether there are sufficient safeguards to prevent their being abused against totally innocent citizens. the government may have a job in persuading this house and the other place that these measures should pass totally unamended in the form that we see them tonight. in considering yet another piece of terrorism legislation, the house should recall the opinion of the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, max hill, when he was appointed just over a year ago. he said that he thought that the uk had sufficient offences in the fight against terrorism and that we did not need any more.']"

in other words, spitting alone - can constitute a common assault. that is true of the criminal justice act 1988, and spitting at an emergency worker of any kind should constitute an assault under this bill. my other amendment - amendment 3 - relates to sexual assault. the major part of the bill introduces an aggravated offence ; that is to say that the bill lists a series of different offences that, when perpetrated against an emergency worker, will be considered to be aggravated. when i drew up the bill, i was primarily thinking of physical violence towards emergency workers. but the truth is that, since i have been working on the bill, my hon. friend the member for halifax and i have received lots of representations, particularly from health service workers, about the sexual assault of ambulance workers, nurses, mental health nurses, doctors and others. one difficulty, both for the government and for us, has been that these statistics have never been gathered by nhs protect, which no longer exists anyway. however, the numbers of such incidents reported by the trade unions working on this matter are quite dramatic, particularly given that the figures show increases. since 2012, such incidents are up 143 % in the east of england ambulance service ; up 40 % in london ; up 133 % in the north west ambulance service ; and up 1500 % in northern ireland.', ""absolutely. in return for the hon. gentleman ' s sense and solidarity in not pressing the amendment, we will focus on making sure that the relevant authorities, particularly the cps, are clearly instructed to consider spitting as included under common assault. i hope that in a small way this speech in the house of commons will re - emphasise, in case anyone is in any doubt, that it is parliament ' s intention that spitting should always be included within the offence of common assault. that brings us to the amendment and various new clauses tabled by my hon. friend the member for shipley, which would further increase the penalty for assaulting emergency workers, police officers and prison officers. this is a complex set of new clauses. new clauses 1 and 2 relate to the existing law - in particular the police act 1996, as it relates to a police officer in the execution of their duty - and seek to do two things. the first is to increase the maximum penalty from six months to 12 months. on that, we respectfully argue that if the bill passes today, we will have already increased to 12 months the maximum penalty for such an assault on a police officer in the exercise of their functions. it would therefore be unnecessary to further amend the police act. the aim of new clause 2 and amendment 9 is to double the maximum penalty from 12 months to 24 months either by amending the police act or dealing with the criminal justice act 2003. the government wish to resist this approach because we have to weigh up two principles. on the one hand, we believe very strongly that emergency workers are entitled to a particular form of respect and protection because they work on our behalf - they provide services to us ; they represent us."", 'there are two aspects to the bill. the first is the offence of common assault, which i think is now drawn in such a way that the courts will be able to circumvent some of the arguments that have thus far been used to prevent any kind of successful prosecution. the second aspect relates to the aggravated offence, and the hon. gentleman is absolutely right that we have not included every single offence in the world. if amendment 3 is accepted this morning, i think that we will have included all offences that could relate to emergency workers. the minister was right to say that it is important that we take cognisance of the fact that, with this bill, we are saying that emergency workers are going to be treated slightly differently in law from the rest of the wider public. it is not that i want to create great hierarchies in society, with some people being more important than others ; it is that emergency workers are suffering these attacks and assaults because they are emergency workers, and that places a greater onus on us to ensure that they have the protections that they need. i return to amendment 2 and the question of whether spitting is common assault. the sentencing council has in recent years looked at whether spitting increases the culpability and seriousness of the offence, and it removed spitting from each of those categories in 2012. quite a lot of magistrates and judges have now started to say that this is one of the primary reasons that there has been a deflation in the number of successful prosecutions and in the sentences that are handed down. i regret the fact that spitting was removed by the sentencing council and hope that it will revisit that decision in the near future. i hope that the minister might also be able to say something about how we can ensure that the courts take spitting seriously as a part of common assault offences.']"

we have got to get it right in our own hospitals and across the nhs and the whole united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland, and then we can look further afield to other countries. he reminds me that last year i had occasion to be in hospital three times for various operations. i never had any infections. i had nothing but the best care. the surgeon ' s knife went in the right direction and removed what had to removed. it was important to do that. the important thing is that we have hospitals and an nhs that are excellent. when the nhs works well, it is the best in the world, but sometimes we need to think about things. the cost of infections to the nhs includes the immediate costs of treating patients in hospital, bed - blocking and so on. there are also issues with hospital capacity, which has reached 100 % in some cases. the world health organisation estimates that 50 % to 70 % of hospital - acquired infections are transmitted by hands, so improving hand hygiene must play a central role in any strategy to reduce hospital infections. it would be remiss of me not to note the work carried out by the secretary of state to improve patient safety in the nhs - let us give credit where credit is due. in november 2016, there was a commitment to halve gram - negative infections by 2020. the secretary of state announced he would appoint a new national infection prevention lead, dr ruth may. both are important steps in bringing down infection rates and show a commitment to do so. given that 50 % to 70 % of hospital infections are transmitted by hands, i was encouraged to see alongside those measures a commitment for the nhs to publish staff hand hygiene indicators for the first time."", 'i beg to move, that this house has considered raising standards of infection prevention and control in the nhs. this issue has been brought to my attention by a number of health organisations, and by lobby groups within the house as well. we are very aware that 5 may marked world hand hygiene day and i am very glad to have secured this debate, to draw attention to the importance of infection prevention and control in the nhs and, in particular, the role of good hand hygiene in raising standards. the first time the matter came to my attention was when my brother keith had a serious motorbike accident some 12 years ago. whenever we visited him in the royal victoria hospital, we were told by the nurses to wash our hands : a€œeverything has to be very, very hygienic in here. a€ we washed our hands almost to the point of obsession because in that ward people were between life and death, and infection could have meant the end of a life. this year, world hand hygiene day focused on raising awareness about sepsis. we all know about sepsis through our constituents and the stories in the press as well. the world health organisation estimates that sepsis affects some 30 million patients worldwide every year. in response to a business question that i put to the leader of the house, she suggested i seek a debate in westminster hall on the matter. as i am not very often here, i thought i would introduce a debate myself for a change - it would perhaps be an occasion. here in the uk, there are 44, 000 deaths from sepsis every year and it is a priority area for the secretary of state. effective hand hygiene plays a key role in reducing the risk of healthcare - associated infections such as e. coli, which are a major risk factor for developing sepsis.']"

operation is therefore actively supporting business and tourism by removing a barrier to people ' s life choices. arguably the greatest beneficiaries of these arrangements are our citizens who live on the continent, many of whom are enjoying their golden years in the sun. the framework put in place by the bill will ensure that the secretary of state has the necessary power to maintain or negotiate arrangements in any brexit eventuality. one of my constituents recently emphasised the importance of having these arrangements. his grandmother, who is now over 80, lives alone in france. a few years ago, she had a car accident that left her seriously injured. she required an operation and spent over a month in hospital. that was followed up by time in a convalescent home. all that care would have cost a small fortune but, luckily for her, she enjoys healthcare under the european health insurance card s1 route. access to that is fundamental to her and to the other 190, 000 pensioners like her, particularly as their health needs may increase over time. the bill should calm the anxieties of our citizens abroad. it will also save the taxpayer money."", 'i beg to move, that the bill be now read a second time. this is a short bill, with six clauses, to enable continuity of healthcare for british nationals and eu citizens after britain leaves the european union. it is clearly in the interests of the british public to ensure reciprocal healthcare arrangements continue when we leave the eu, whether that happens through an agreement with the eu itself or through individual agreements with eu member states. by enabling us to implement those arrangements, the bill will help us to help nearly 200, 000 british pensioners living in eu countries to continue to access the medical treatment that they need, and it will mean that the hundreds of thousands of british citizens who require medical treatment each year during holidays in europe can still be covered for medical assistance when they need it. the bill will help to ensure that uk nationals who live and work in eu countries can continue to access healthcare on the same basis as local people. it will mean that eu citizens can be covered for reciprocal healthcare here, so that the uk continues to be a place tourists want to visit and vital workers, such as our nhs workforce, want to live in. the bill will also mean that we can continue to recover healthcare costs from europe as we do now.', 'i am grateful for this opportunity to close the debate on behalf of labour. it is clear that members on both sides of the house understand the importance of the bill. the uk currently enjoys reciprocal agreements for the provision of healthcare with all the nations of the european union. under existing arrangements, the healthcare of 190, 000 uk state pensioners living abroad - principally in ireland, spain, france and cyprus - and their dependent relatives is protected. in addition, uk residents who visit the eu or the european economic area on holiday or to study may use the european health insurance card to access healthcare for emergency treatment and healthcare needs that arise during their stay. anyone who is ordinarily resident in the uk qualifies for an ehic and 250, 000 claims for medical treatment are made each year under this scheme. by the same token, eu nationals visiting the uk can use their ehic to receive free care from the nhs for any emergency healthcare needs and for healthcare needs that arise during their stay. i am grateful to the hon. member for chelmsford ( vicky ford ) for reminding the house that the card does not cover repatriation and other associated expenses, but visitors to the eu can currently be reassured that their immediate emergency costs will be met. that is something that we would seek to protect. by means of the s1 form and the ehic, current arrangements also provide for the healthcare of employees of uk companies and organisations working in the eu and the eea, as well as for that of frontier workers living there, and vice versa. importantly, the agreement also provides funding for uk residents to travel overseas to receive planned treatment in other countries - for example, for procedures unavailable in the uk within a medically justifiable timescale, or to return home to give birth.']"

i hope that the minister will be able to tell us further about what it means. people need to plan for the future, so if a£900 million is going to be taken out of public health grants, we need to know that now. when we ask the public which parts of the system they prioritise, public health tends to be at the bottom of the list. it is up to the government to look at the evidence, and they must be clear that the evidence shows that we must focus unrelentingly on the prevention arm of healthcare. that is the right thing to do, and it is where we have the greatest chance of tackling the burning injustices of health inequality, so it is an important point to address. the other aspect i want to touch on is social care. the health and social care committee has just had a sitting with the care quality commission on its excellent a€œstate of carea€ report. the report comments on a€œfragility, a€ and the report of a couple of years ago talked about a€œa tipping point. a€ the cqc told us that that tipping point has been passed for many people in social care.', 'last week, the chancellor confirmed that the nhs budget would rise by a£20. 5 billion over the next five years, because we care about the nhs being there for everyone. as well as money, however, reform is crucial. before christmas, we will bring forward a long - term plan for the nhs. we know that so much of what contributes to good health comes not just from what happens when someone is in hospital but from what we do to stay out of hospital. prevention is better than cure. today i have laid before the house our vision for the prevention of ill health. it covers what the nhs needs to do, including more funding for community and primary care and the better use of technology. the plan also outlines what we need to see more broadly ; everyone has a part to play. as well as the rights we have as citizens to access nhs services free at the point of use, we all have responsibilities, too. individuals have responsibilities, and we want to empower people to make the right choices. for instance, smoking costs the nhs a£2. 5 billion each year and contributes to 4 % of hospital admissions. that is despite the massive reduction in smoking over the past 30 years. the next step to a smoke - free society is targeted anti - smoking interventions, especially in hospitals. as well as stopping smoking, we must tackle excess salt. salt intake has fallen 11 % over just under a decade, but if it fell by a third, that would prevent 8, 000 premature deaths and save the nhs over a£500 million annually. we are working on new solutions to tackle salt, and we will set out more details by easter and deliver on chapter 2 of our obesity plan, too. next, prevention can save money and eliminate waste. at the moment, it takes too long, with too many invasive tests, to diagnose some illnesses.', ""it is not rubbish. professor sir michael marmot warned : a€œif we don ' t spend appropriately on social care, if we don ' t spend appropriately on health care, the quality of life will get worse for older people and maybe the length of life, tooa€. sadly, we have seen this across the board. despite the growing pressure on our health and social care service, the government are responsible for spending cuts across our nhs, social care and public health services. while demand continues to increase, the government have taken away vital funding, which could close the life expectancy gap. since local authorities became responsible for public health budgets in 2015, it is estimated by the king ' s fund that, on a like - for - like basis, public health spending will have fallen by 5. 2 %. that follows a a£200 million in - year cut to public health spending in 2015 - 16. further real - term cuts are to come, averaging between 3. 9 % each year between 2016 - 17 and 2020 - 21. on the ground, that means cuts to spending on tackling drug misuse among adults of more than a£22 million compared with last year and smoking cessation services cut by almost a£16 million. spending to tackle obesity, which the hon. member for south west bedfordshire mentioned as a cause of shorter life expectancy, has also fallen by 18. 5 % between 2015 - 16 and 2016 - 17 and further cuts are in the pipeline. these are vital services for local communities and could benefit their health and lifestyle, but sadly they continue to be cut due to lack of funding. how does the minister expect to close the life expectancy gap without investing properly in vital public health services? an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.""]"

14 to 2015 - 16, and the subsequent freeze on the majority of social security payments, have caused low - income households to suffer a significant deterioration in the adequacy of social security support. the freeze to payments and support is having a detrimental impact on millions of people on low incomes across the uk. inflation has more than doubled in the past year. it hit 3. 1 % in november, and it is now at 2. 7 %."", ""i will try to be brief. i am bewildered about what this debate is supposed to achieve. the hon. member for ayr, carrick and cumnock ( bill grant ) agreed with many of the points we put to him - for example, that social security is a human right. i wonder what the minister will think of that. we will take no lessons from the labour party. it does not matter what the hon. member for glasgow north east ( mr sweeney ) says, a£12 billion - worth of cuts on welfare went through in 2015 and 184 labour mps abstained. that is why we need to have people in here protecting scotland ' s interests. the hon. member for ayr, carrick and cumnock talked of the need for mitigation. by definition, if we need to mitigate tory cuts in scotland, that suggests that the tory cuts should not be taking place. in setting up the new welfare system in scotland, there has been widespread consultation. for the hon. gentleman to suggest that it is some dark secret and nobody knows what is happening is clearly nonsense. his colleague, adam tomkins msp, talked about the welfare legislation in scotland as being landmark legislation and the great consensus around it. it is a pity that the hon. gentleman cannot agree with his tory colleagues in the scottish parliament. adam tomkins msp congratulated the scottish government on bringing the legislation forward in the form that they did. it is very clear that the only people who are standing up for the people who find themselves relying on benefits -"", ""to paraphrase mike russell, i am afraid i have too few minutes and too much to contradict the tories on. i am very sorry, but i do not have enough time. i have taken other interventions. we will establish an independent scrutiny body - the scottish commission on social security - and we have a legal duty to scrutinise proposals for regulations and have regard to human rights. the new agency will seek medical information at the outset of an application - applicants will not be required to collect it at appeal stage - so face - to - face assessments will be reduced. the legislative process required to deal with the successful transition of 11 benefits is still going on in holyrood, so there may be more detail to come. those who contradict the hon. member for ayr, carrick and cumnock are not restricted to snp members. i am keen to quote a couple of his colleagues in the scottish parliament. on 19 december, the tory spokes -

the fact that he will go after those who are not paying their tax and after those who use a digital platform and currently have an advantage over those who pay rates on the high street ; and the fact that small businesses will have greater rate relief. i am also pleased by some of the announcements about northern ireland. there is about a£1 billion of funding here for northern ireland."", ""two major issues act as a backdrop to the chancellor ' s budget. first is the prime minister ' s pledge that austerity is over, and it is worth remembering what she said : a€œa decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off. a€that is unequivocal. we expected to see the end of austerity made real today by the chancellor, if that is indeed the government ' s policy. secondly, unless they can be stopped by this house, tory brexit plans are likely to impose a massive economic shock on the uk, and the harder the brexit engineered by our government, the worse that shock will be. we have already lost 2 % to 2. 5 % of expected gdp growth over the past two years, according to the office for budget responsibility, because of the uncertainty created by brexit and the government ' s incompetence in dealing with it. the chancellor has dodged dealing with brexit uncertainties today by completely ignoring them and promising us an emergency budget in the spring if we crash out of the eu with no deal, as half his cabinet and the most hard - line brexit supporting members of his parliamentary party seek to make us do. as for the idea of ending austerity, what would such a budget look like? not like the budget we have just heard. to be fair to the chancellor, he said only that austerity is coming to an end. in other words, it will be going on for years to come. according to the institute for fiscal studies, the narrowest possible definition of a budget that ensures that austerity is over would require the chancellor to find an extra a£19 billion.""]"

christmas has come early for me. happy christmas to everyone, and thank you to all the staff who run this place. i have said that now, so i will not repeat it. i want to raise the subject of the danger caused by a drug called isotretinoin, which i have already spoken about - perhaps four times - in the house since becoming an mp. to date, i have to say, the collective view of the house has had little impact on actually sorting it out. isotretinoin, also known as accutane or roaccutane, is a drug used to treat severe acne primarily in teenagers - mainly boys. it has dramatic effects : it clears acne up pretty quickly, but its side - effects can be enormous. it can cause severe depression and impotence in those who use it. my concerns stem from contact with constituents, particularly one lady. she is the mother of a young man who has suffered enormously from isotretinoin. at the age of 16, he was given the drug for eight months. as a result, he suffered - forgive my language - complete erectile dysfunction, which has had a life - changing effect on him and, indeed, on his mental state. he is now in his early 20s, and it has of course had a dramatic effect on him. he has been through university, too. unsurprisingly, his mother is distraught, in particular because her son is now almost unwilling even to discuss the matter. i believe that we can all understand that. it must be very difficult for a young man to discuss such a matter with his mother. i, personally - i know i am from another generation - could not even have dreamt of talking about such a matter with my mother.', 'i beg to move, that this house has considered the risks of the use of accutane. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir roger. i particularly wish to speak about the impact of accutane, which can cause depression and impotence when used to treat severe acne. accutane is but one of a series of drugs, each based on isotretinoin. there are several versions of isotretinoin, known variously as accutane, roaccutane, claravis, sotret and amnesteem. these versions of isotretinoin all perform in much the same way. since all five drugs stem from isotretinoin, and indeed the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency - mhra - uses that name, i will use it to cover all five of them collectively. originally, isotretinoin was marketed as a chemotherapy drug. based on the evidence of friends who have undergone chemotherapy, i am immediately warned to watch out for side effects. i do not suffer any more from teenage acne or have the urgent need to get it under control that could easily make me overcome misgivings in a bid to get rid of such a curse. the effects of isotretinoin were last debated on 3 december 2013 in this very place. i took part in that debate because i was concerned to hear about the effects of isotretinoin on the nephew of one of my then constituents. worries about the effects of isotretinoin had been debated in parliament some 10 years before that. this seems to be a problem that will not go away and for which we have no scientifically based answer. i was spurred to call this debate by a constituent who prefers to remain anonymous, but whose son - a totally happy young man - has had his life totally disrupted since taking isotretinoin for severe acne.']"

a€ i was not asking him if he was on acid. it was a more general question, although i noticed that he readily jumped up and said yes. he makes an important point about ensuring that once the changes are made, all those who need to be aware of them will get training in the process of bringing them about. as he knows, this will involve trading standards and local authorities, and we are in touch with those groups. by the time the bill has progressed and hopefully achieved royal assent, we will have worked quite intensively with the groups that have an interest in this to ensure that the measures in the bill are well understood. if i may turn to knives, it is already against the law to sell knives to under - 18s, but some online sellers effectively ignore this. sadly, such knives can get into the hands of young people and this has led to tragic deaths. we will stop that by ensuring that proper age checks are in place at the point of sale. we will stop the delivery to a home address of knives that can cause serious injury. we will also crack down on the overseas sales of knives by making it an offence to deliver them to a person under 18 in this country. i find it appalling that vicious weapons are on open sale and easily available. it shocks me that flick knives are still available despite being banned as long ago as 1959, and that zombie knives, knuckledusters and other dreadful weapons are still in wide circulation. the bill will therefore make it an offence to possess such weapons, whether in private or on the streets, and it will go further and extend the current ban on offensive weapons in schools to further education premises.']"

it must be separate from the nhs to ensure real independence, and it must investigate and act on concerns. if a local investigation has failed or is failing, there should be a mechanism to report that to an independent body. if we get to the point where there is simply a slanging match within a trust, there will never be a satisfactory resolution, so arbitration needs to come in and look at the cold facts and the original facts of the disclosure. often, what is looked at is the process, but not whether the whistleblower was actually right to raise an issue in the first place. it is critical that whistleblowers are protected from detriment from the moment of speaking up. they should be protected during the investigation, and they must not be picked on either subtly, as the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) said, or blatantly - they must not lose their jobs. it is important that legal penalties for reprisals against whistleblowers can actually be enforced. there should be a system of redress for whistleblowers that does not involve litigation. litigation is expensive for the nhs and the whistleblower, and is utterly confrontational.']"

when will sir charles godfray ' s review of the government ' s tb policy be published? will it consider the use of vaccination as an alternative to shooting? some horrific video footage has been obtained from the badger cull area in cumbria. a caged badger was shot and took almost a minute to die, writhing in agony. the shooter then flagrantly disregarded the biosecurity guidelines, took the badger out of the cage and failed to bag it up - little wonder that the government ' s policy has not been particularly successful in reducing the spread of tb."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the badger cull. it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir david, in a debate on this very important issue, because i know that you take a close interest in it. however, i am amazed that five years after the badger cull started we are still debating it. if you will bear with me, sir david, i remember speaking on this issue on 5 june 2013. i quoted lord krebs, who chaired a review team that originated the idea of the randomised badger culling trial. he was interviewed on the a€œtodaya€ programme on 12 october 2012, and said : a€œthe scientific case is as clear as it can be : this cull is not the answer to tb in cattle. a€i have found no scientists who are experts in population biology or in the distribution of infectious diseases in wildlife who think that culling is a good idea. people seem to have cherry - picked certain results to try to support their argument. i also quoted lord robert may, a former government chief scientist and president of the royal society, who said : a€œit is very clear to me that the government ' s policy does not make sense... i have no sympathy with the decision. they are transmuting evidence - based policy into policy - based evidence. a€another former government chief scientist, professor sir john beddington, also refused to back the cull. more than 30 scientists signed a letter that was published in the observer on 14 october 2012 and states thata€œthe complexities of tb transmission mean that licensed culling risks increasing cattle tb rather than reducing ita€. the letter ends by saying, a€œculling badgers as planned is very unlikely to contribute to tb eradication. a€"", ""i am disappointed that the minister did not give way at the end. i think it is very unfair to characterise the situation as being the fault of the previous labour government. let us remember that it was the previous labour government who - rather controversially - actually backed the randomised badger cull tests from which the conclusion was drawn that the way to tackle bovine tb was not through a badger cull. i repeat that the body of evidence from the scientists involved in the randomised badger cull tests showed that carrying on with the badger cull could have made matters worse. we have seen over the last five years of this horrific cull, which continues, that, even putting the appalling cruelty to one side, it is simply not working. it is all very well for the minister to get up and say that various peer - reviewed reports have implied that it has worked, but the evidence speaks for itself. how can the minister stand there and say that it has worked when the proportion of tb in cattle herds is virtually the same as at the start of the cull, and when it has even spread to other areas? the government are looking in the wrong direction. i heard what the minister said, but i implore him to go back and look again at pursuing a different route, at the cattle movements, at the fraud that takes place, at biosecurity and at doing proper testing and supporting farmers in doing so, rather than expecting them to stump up for the bill. this is an appalling state of affairs. i repeat that there is no scientific evidence to support the government ' s position. public opinion is overwhelmingly opposed to the badger cull, which does not serve the farming community in any way, shape or form and certainly does not serve the interests of wildlife in our country.""]"

we are certainly in agreement about that. the government truly believe in and recognise the power of the arts to transform places and, indeed, people ' s lives. i passionately believe that and know it to be true. as the hon. gentleman will know, arts council england rightly operates at arm ' s length from the government. in those circumstances, it would be wrong for a minister of the crown to intervene in, or comment too specifically on, individual funding cases. i shall therefore begin by discussing the arts council ' s role and the support that it provides at a broader level. the arts council ' s mission is a€œgreat art and culture for everyonea€, which it seeks to achieve through advocacy and investment in line with its 10 - year plan. it works to make the arts, and the wider culture of museums and libraries, an integral part of everyday public life, accessible to all and understood as essential to the national economy and the health and happiness of society. on the hon. gentleman ' s specific point, the arts council has worked very hard in recent years to ensure that investment outside london has increased as a percentage and in cash terms. he will be pleased to hear that last year some 70 % of arts council funding was awarded outside london. between 2018 and 2022, an additional a£170 million will be invested outside london."", ""the fact of the matter is that the arts council has made significant progress, as i have outlined, in delineating moneys outside the london area. it is also important that my department and i access all people throughout england. arts council england is focused on that too. i should like to take this opportunity to congratulate sue williamson, who joins the arts council as director of libraries from st helens library service, which i referred to a moment ago. she most recently delivered its award - winning cultural hubs and arts in libraries programme, and oversaw the successful application to the arts council ' s national portfolio. another arts council - funded scheme is first art, which is a collective of four cultural and community organisations working within former coalfields in north - east derbyshire and north - east nottinghamshire. it aims to bring inspiring cultural experiences within reach of everyone in ashfield, bolsover, mansfield and north - east derbyshire over the next two years. it is a very exciting programme. the hon. member for bassetlaw raised the issue of funding for coalfield communities at prime minister ' s questions a few weeks ago, when he alleged an inequality of funding by comparing funding for coalfield communities with funding in the london borough of islington, which he mentioned again this evening. i am happy to correct that assertion on the record. having read his letter to me following prime minister ' s questions, i see that his figures are based on the arts council ' s national portfolio funding only, which led to the conclusion of a discrepancy in funding. in actual fact, although the national portfolio organisation funding is an incredibly important part of the arts council ' s work - it provides regular funding over a set period to some of england ' s most vital cultural institutions - it is by no means the only form of funding it distributes.""]"

the promoters may not thank me for saying this - it should not be the case that, for example, the commissioners ' mates or one particular group end up finding themselves on the navigation advisory committee. however, the promoters were happy to accept the idea that relevant interests should be declared and that there should be clear processes for how that works."", ""members will be pleased to know that i can be relatively brief. the government support the bill, which is promoted by the middle level commissioners, a statutory corporation constituted under the middle level act 1862. we have had a good debate this evening and i commend the many probing amendments that my hon. friend the member for christchurch ( sir christopher chope ) tabled, but i believe that all the points he raised have been dealt with comprehensively, in particular by my hon. friend the member for torbay ( kevin foster ), who has a deep grasp of all the detail of the bill. the legal framework that governs the commissioners ' navigation function is made up of a number of 18th and 19th century acts, which are now considerably out of date and do not align with modern requirements or the statutory framework that is applicable to other navigation authorities. in particular, the current legal framework that governs the commissioners does not include adequate provision for the registration of vessels using the waterways or the levying of charges for the use of the waterways and associated facilities. as a result, the commissioners do not receive any income from the navigation of the waterways, which has meant that moneys raised through drainage rates and levies have had to be used to fund navigation rather than for flood defence purposes, which is contrary to government policy. the commissioners are therefore seeking to update and clarify their powers to enable them to properly regulate and fund their waterways. the powers that they are seeking are similar to those used by other large inland navigation authorities, for example the canal and river trust, the environment agency and the broads authority. i very much support the bill and hope that it will pass unamended this evening."", ""i am pleased to respond on the opposition ' s behalf to this opposed private business. although it might not be the most conventional way to introduce legislative change, and i have heard the detailed reservations of the hon. member for christchurch ( sir christopher chope ), we are none the less satisfied that the bill makes sense, and our intention is to support the bill as it stands. although the bill is fairly narrow in scope, we acknowledge that it has important consequences for those who will be affected. we are satisfied that due scrutiny has taken place in committee and is taking place at consideration stage this afternoon. the middle level of the fens was first drained in the 17th century to reclaim an area of farmland in cambridgeshire and west norfolk. the middle level commissioners are the navigation authority for the waterways, established through a series of local acts passed between 1663 and 1874, so we appreciate that the legislative framework underpinning the role of the commissioners is in need of an update. this is not least because almost all the fenland within the middle level waterways is below sea level, and if it was not for a complex system of flood mitigation and drainage schemes managed by the commissioners, the waterways could pose a significant risk to the estimated 100, 000 people who live and work in the area. in the simplest terms, the bill will introduce a registration scheme for vessels in the middle level and allow the commissioners to bring in revenue from boat owners that will be used to improve the waterways. the environment agency, the canal and river trust and the broads authority all have similar powers in respect of their own navigations, so in many ways, the bill is long overdue in bringing the middle level into line with its neighbours.""]"

they pay about a third more corporation tax proportionately than a non - bank corporation does. the second is through the bank levy. although the bank levy is being reduced, it will remain in force, so banks will continue to pay proportionately more tax than non - bank businesses after the implementation of this budget. that is a vital point to get across. the hon. gentleman also tried to link funding for children ' s services to the bank levy. in one of my interventions, i gave some figures on the total amount of tax that banks are paying. we can argue about why they are paying that extra tax. clearly, it is at least in part due to the surplus profits rate and to the bank levy. it may also, in part, be due to the fact that the banks ' profits have increased."", ""perhaps we can get into the nitty - gritty of this offline. the average revenue from the bank levy between its introduction in 2011 and 2015 - 16 was around a£2. 6 billion. as a result of this package, however, yield from the surcharge and the levy in 2022 - 23 is forecast to be a£3. 2 billion. by 2023, as i have said, we will have raised around a£44 billion in additional bank taxes since the 2010 election. opposition members have also suggested that our bank levy is set at a low level compared with other countries. in fact, not all financial centres have a bank levy. the usa, for example, chose not to introduce one at all, and while several eu countries introduced bank levies following the financial crisis, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between these levies as the rules for each are different. we have heard the argument this afternoon that we should reintroduce a tax on bankers ' pay. one of the aims of the changes to bank taxation announced in 2015 and 2016 is to ensure a sustainable long - term basis for taxing banks, based on taxing bank profits and the bank levy. by contrast, the bank payroll tax referred to in new clause 3 was always intended as a one - off tax. reintroducing it would be ineffective and unsustainable compared with the package of banking tax measures that we have introduced. even the last labour chancellor pointed out that it could not be repeated without significant tax avoidance. opposition members also propose that hmrc should publish a register of tax paid by individual banks under the levy. taxpayer confidentiality is rightly a core principle for trust in our tax system and hmrc does not publish details of the amount of tax paid by any individual business.""]"

i think, and our committee agrees - in a far too narrow way. the charity commission guidance for students unions indicated that it would consider it acceptable for charitable students unions to comment ona€œstreet lighting near the campusa€because the issue affects students as students, and therefore fulfils their charitable purposes. the charity commission would consider it unacceptable for students unions to comment publicly on issues that do not directly affect the welfare of students as students, such as, a€œthe treatment of political prisoners in a foreign country. a€that is the charity commission ' s own example, illustrating the point raised by my hon. friend the member for stafford. the minister told our committee that the charity commission guidance shoulda€œgo further and facilitate the promotion of free speech. it should be giving students ' unions the permission to host debates about controversial issues and expose students to a wide range of viewpoints. that should be the core purpose. a€that is quite right."", ""this inquiry is one of the most important that we have undertaken in my three years on the joint committee on human rights. as we have heard, we received some very disturbing evidence. free speech is indeed a foundation for democracy in society, and universities are places where many of tomorrow ' s leaders learn how to explore ideas in a way that prepares them to engage in and influence wider society, so it is critical that free speech is secured in universities. a key part of all students ' education is the ability to engage in dialogue and contentious debate. universities have a legal duty under the education act to secure freedom of speech within the law, both for students and for visiting speakers. if we do not prepare students to engage in dialogue in an environment that promotes free speech, there is a serious danger that we will risk promoting extremism and factionalism within wider society. only by understanding different views and beliefs and by, as one of our witnesses said, countering bad ideas with good ones, will we build community cohesion and break down prejudice and discrimination in wider society, which, at worst, as we know, can lead to violent disturbances within our local communities. that is something that none of us wants. indeed, it is one of the purposes of the prevent strategy. it is ironic that the strategy is in many ways defeating one of its key objectives in the way that it is applied at universities. i will come on to that in more detail shortly. for the record, i will set the legal scene, which the committee is now well versed in. article 9 of the european convention on human rights states that, a€œeveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion."", ""that is an excellent example. i hope it will also encourage students to the right of karl marx, because i have spoken to a number of students who have recently said, a€œi wouldn ' t admit to being a conservative on campus. a€our committee concluded that the concept of safe spaces, having been extended to entire university campuses, is unhelpful. it is not only unhelpful. if minority views are supressed across the whole campus, but they are not views that are promoting terrorism or inciting the kind of activity i referred to earlier, the concept is actually against the law, impinging on the right to free speech under article 10 of the european convention on human rights. a number of students unions tried to argue in evidence to us that it was necessary to limit speakers who cause harm through speech - harm caused because people might find speech disturbing or upsetting. as our report says, however, this is counter or detrimental to free speech. regarding safe spaces, we say : a€œwhilst there must be opportunities for genuinely sensitive and confidential discussions in university settings, and whilst the original intention behind safe space policies may have been to ensure that minority or vulnerable groups can feel secure, in practice the concept of safe spaces has proved problematic, often marginalising the views of minority groups. they need to co - exist with and respect free speech. they cannot cover the whole of the university or university life without impinging on rights to free speech... when that happens, people are moving from the need to have a a€œsafe spacea€ to seeking to prevent the free speech of those whose views they disagree with. minority groups or individuals holding unpopular opinions which are within the law should not be shut down nor be subject to undue additional scrutiny by students ' unions or universities.""]"

drawn carriages and submarines should have been covered by the bill - we thank them for that. some of our learned labour colleagues in the other place were more than qualified to speak about this topic, as one is a former airline pilot and another the president of the british airline pilots association. i pay particular tribute to them for their work on this issue, and we thank the government for the technical amendments that they tabled in response to the concessions that we won. i reiterate the point that our colleagues in the other place made about enforcement. we have over 21, 000 fewer police officers compared with in 2010.', 'the bill has been much improved by the persistence of our labour colleagues in the other place. i am sure that the whole house would want to join me in sending condolences to my hon. friend the member for kingston upon hull east ( karl turner ). he had been leading for the opposition on the bill, but he has just lost his father, the distinguished hull city councillor ken turner. our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family today. as no amendments were tabled, i shall highlight a few points in the bill itself. it is a short bill, consisting of two substantive and two procedural clauses. clause 1 makes it an offence to direct or shine a laser beam towards a vehicle or a person in charge of a vehicle in such a way as to dazzle or distract the person driving, piloting, navigating or otherwise in control of the vehicle when it is moving or is ready to move. it results from an amendment tabled by labour colleagues in the other place. there may be mitigating circumstances if it can be proved that the use of the laser was necessary in, for example, a rescue mission to attract attention of a pilot, or that the offence was committed by accident if the laser was being used professionally and all precautions had initially been taken to prevent an incident from occurring. the penalty will be imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. advancing the deterrent sends a clear message that laser misuse will not be tolerated. it has also been clarified that a laser beam could be a pulsed or continuous light, and it is defined in clause 3. the definition of the modes of transport to which the bill will apply has been extended, thanks to the work of my labour colleagues in the other place. the bill is an important piece of health and safety legislation to safeguard those who operate modes of transport from the effect of laser misuse.', 'five years is indeed the maximum sentence and the maximum fine is unlimited. the bill extends to the entire uk and will come into force in england, wales and scotland at the end of the period of two months beginning with the day on which the bill is passed. in northern ireland, aviation and shipping are reserved, and the provisions relating to those will come into force at the same time as in the rest of the uk. the bill is now in a better shape than when it was introduced. in particular, the creation of an offence for shining a laser at air traffic control has received widespread endorsement and is one that the government are happy to support. the bill has been a great example of the important role parliament has in strengthening legislation. i also thank those outside the chamber who have lent their expertise to this important bill. the uk laser working group, chaired by air commodore dai whittingham, the civil aviation authority, nats, the maritime and coastguard agency, the trade union the british airline pilots association, the national police air service and many others have provided invaluable advice on some very technical issues. our work in this area does not stop once the bill is passed. the bill specifically covers the risk posed by shining a laser at a person in control of a vehicle, but, as we discussed on second reading, the government have also announced new measures to tackle the sale of unsafe laser pointers. more than 150 incidents of eye injuries involving laser pointers have been reported since 2013, the vast majority of them involving children. in many of these cases, neither the children nor their parents have known the danger involved. the government will work to raise awareness of the risks associated with laser pointers, including among schoolchildren. in addition, the government have pledged extra support to local authority ports and border teams to stop high - powered laser pointers entering the uk.']"

class pshe looks like, going forward into the 2020s. i hope that this debate will be a useful part of that process. pshe in this country has suffered on several fronts. it has been caught up in sterile debates about the difference between knowledge and skills, and about school freedom. it has also become a battleground because of its status as the home of sex and relationships education. it has been incorrectly associated with generic and sometimes obscure pet subjects - even origami. often, we have lost sight of the fact that pshe at its best supports the development of skills and attributes such as managing risk and taking responsibility, and the honing of critical skills that set young people up to succeed in other areas of the curriculum and in their wider lives. surely that is what education is about. despite some of the cartoon battles that i have mentioned, there is a fair level of consensus about what pshe includes : the knowledge and skills that young people need to stay safe - online and offline - healthy, and prepared for life.', ""at that point, if the child wishes to have sex education, the headteacher should ensure they receive it in one of those three terms. this preserves the parental right in most cases, but balances that with the child ' s right to opt in to sex education when they are competent to do so. we are keen to hear as many views as possible through the consultation, and i encourage members and their constituents to respond. the consultation will be open until early november and the final regulations will be laid in both houses, allowing for a full and considered debate. this very important change to the curriculum has to be delivered well, and although many schools will be able to adapt their existing teaching quickly, it is essential that schools that need more time to plan and to prepare their staff get that time. it is our intention that as many schools as possible will start teaching the subjects from september 2019. we will be working with schools, as well as with multi - academy trusts, dioceses and education unions, to help them to do so. all schools will be required to teach the new subjects from september 2020, which is in line with the department ' s approach that any significant changes to the curriculum have a year ' s lead - in time. that will enable us to learn lessons from early - adopter schools and to share good practice further across the sector. we will be seeking views through the consultation to test the right focus for a school support package as we know that it is crucial for schools and teachers to be confident and well prepared. our proposals are an historic step in education that will help to equip children and young people with the knowledge and support that they need to form healthy relationships, lead healthy lives, and be safe and happy in modern britain. i commend the statement to the house."", 'i thank the hon. lady for the tone and content of her response. i join her in thanking and commending all those on both sides of the house who have been involved in the development of these matters over quite an extended period, particularly during the passage of the bill that became the children and social work act. the hon. lady asked what was truly mandatory. the only part of the curriculum that it is possible to withdraw from is the sex part of relationships and sex education. if a primary school offered sex education - that is not mandatory, but if it were - the right to withdraw would also apply there. the hon. lady asked - it is a reasonable question - how we make sure this actually happens. schools have an obligation to have regard to guidance, and they do. there is also, of course, the system of ofsted inspection, which looks at the moral and spiritual development of children. on how the right to withdraw will operate and the ability of children to opt in, there will continue to be, as i outlined in my statement, a parental right to withdraw. its nature will change because the age - 18 right is no longer consistent with legal precedent. there are cases where the parent wishes to withdraw the child from sex education and the child does not want that, but we are not expecting large numbers of those. only a very small number of parents now withdraw their children from sex education ; of course, there is sex education in most schools. in that case, the child would be able to access a term of sex education before reaching 16. the hon. lady is absolutely right about bullying, including bullying of children who are lgbt. a couple of things are very important and essential in that regard.']"

in a no - deal scenario, clients in some jurisdictions might be limited in how they can received uk legal advice from uk lawyers. currently uk lawyers have the automatic right to set up practices in an eu host state with minimal bureaucracy ; in a no - deal scenario, uk lawyers ' ability to set up practices in an eu27 jurisdiction will depend on local laws and regulations. if establishment is possible, permitted activities still might be limited. currently uk lawyers have the right to advise clients who are based in the eu27 on eu law, because their legal professional qualifications are automatically recognised."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, ms buck. as a former solicitor, i know only too well the vital services provided by the legal profession, not only to clients in the uk but across europe and globally. legal services are the largest market in the eu, thanks to the strength and stability of english and welsh law, our independent courts and judiciary and the excellence of our legal service providers. the contribution of the legal services sector to the uk economy was worth more than a£26 billion, or 1. 5 % of the uk ' s gdp, in 2017, so any impact of brexit on legal services would have a knock - on effect on the uk economy. the sector employs more than 380, 000 people and the latest statistics suggest that the legal services sector was responsible for a net export of more than a£4 billion. at the moment, european directives mean that lawyers and law firms are able to benefit from a simple, predictable and uniform system that allows them a temporary or permanent presence in other eu member states. uk lawyers are able to service the cross - border needs of businesses and individuals from both satellite offices in the eu and london offices, and 36 out of the 50 top uk law firms have at least one office in another eu or eea state or in switzerland. they have a presence in 26 of those 31 countries. as lawyers from an eu member state, uk lawyers can appear before eu courts. if we were to lose those rights, uk lawyers would not be able to advise on areas such as competition, intellectual property or trade, due to restrictions on rights of audience at certain eu institutions, such as the court of justice of the european union. those are all currently lucrative practices for uk - qualified lawyers and bring business to uk law firms. losing such business could be economically catastrophic for firms and for the uk economy."", ""my hon. friend makes a very important point. at the moment, the uk is the jurisdiction of choice for the majority of commercial law contracts, litigation that follows from them, and commercial law arbitration, but we cannot take that for granted. a number of english language commercial courts that apply uk law have already been established elsewhere in the world. as i understand it, another is proposed in amsterdam, which would clearly have an impact once we leave the eu. mutual recognition of judgments is one of the uk legal sector ' s key asks, and he anticipated with great timeliness that i was about to move on to what the law society, the bar council, the city of london corporation, the cityuk and others in the sector are looking for from the government to maintain the position of uk legal services once we leave the eu. the legal services sector ' s key priorities are as follows. first, eu27 legal providers should be permitted to provide services in the uk, and vice versa - uk legal providers should be able to provide services in the eu27 - on the basis of mutual recognition of regulatory regimes. that would enable european lawyers based in london firms and uk lawyers based in the eu27 to continue to advise and represent their clients. secondly, the uk and the eu27 should continue automatic mutual recognition of legal qualifications gained before and during - and after, i submit - the uk ' s exit from the eu. that ought to be part of the agreement we seek. otherwise, we would be in the perverse position that an english lawyer who, like me, is also qualified in the republic of ireland - i am a member of the irish bar - was able to continue to practise in the eu27 using their irish qualification but not their english qualification.""]"

chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on liver health. i have been the chairman now for some 13 years - simply because i do not think anyone else wants to take on the mantle, to be frank. when we set up our all -

what a joy - anita roddick of the body shop, who was a wonderful and remarkable lady, became our patron. she died in 2007. the house may know that she contracted hepatitis c from a blood transfusion in 1971 and was unaware that she was living with the disease until 2004. a routine blood test revealed the diagnosis. she was a tireless campaigner, and we owe her a great debt of gratitude, but since 2007 we have struggled to find a patron to head up the organisation as president. if colleagues have any ideas, i know our appg would be glad to hear from them.', 'of course, the hon. lady states a fact not an opinion, and i accept that, which is why i speak of the importance of primary care and of making every contact count. the people who portmans pharmacy interacts with are not all sick. people who have a hepatitis c infection or a drug -

in many ways, i am the minister with responsibility for prevention and it is the thing that i am most passionate about in our health service. as well as testing and treating those already infected, an essential part of tackling hepatitis c must be the prevention of infection in the first place, or the prevention of reinfection of those successfully treated, which would not be a smart use of public resources. nhs england and public health england, which i have direct ministerial responsibility for, are actively engaged in programmes at a local level to prevent the spread of infection. as people who inject drugs or share needles are at the greatest risk of acquiring hepatitis c, prevention services, particularly those provided by drug treatment centres, are key components of hepatitis c control strategies. clearly, the key to breaking the cycle of hepatitis c is to prevent infection happening in the first place.', ""it is genuinely a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr streeter, and to be back in westminster hall on such a quiet day in westminster. the hon. member for ealing, southall ( mr sharma ) is sadly not in his place today, but i thank my hon. friend the member for southend west ( sir david amess ) for securing and leading this debate. although he said that he was not the best person to introduce the debate, he could have fooled us because he did it very well. hepatitis c is a significant health issue in our country, and for too long it has been overshadowed by other public health concerns that, despite the superstars involved, have had higher public profiles. i pay tribute to the hepatitis c trust and the wonderful charles gore, whom i have got to know in this job. he is a colossus in this area, and has become a friend. i also thank the hepatitis c coalition -

why not move hydrofluoric acid into part 2 as a regulated poison? it is highly dangerous : as i said in the debate before christmas, exposure on just 2 % of the skin can kill.', 'this has been a wide - ranging and, on the whole, thoughtful debate. there is agreement across the house on the broad themes of the bill : the prohibition of the sale of corrosive substances to under - 18s and the prohibition of the dispatch of bladed products and corrosive substances to residential addresses. i think it right that the government are tackling the issue of online sales, and, more generally, the sale and possession of acid and knives. we want to ensure that death stars and zombie knives, which have no purpose other than to cause harm, are no longer a problem on our streets. i counted no fewer than 20 back - bench speeches today. i pay particular tribute to the speech of my hon. friend the member for west ham ( lyn brown ), who focused on corrosive substances and referred to the 85 attacks that had taken place in newham. she rightly drew attention to the physical and emotional impact of such attacks on victims. she spoke with her usual knowledge and passion, and i pay tribute to her for her sustained campaigning on this issue. i also pay tribute to my right hon. friend the member for east ham ( stephen timms ) for his speech. he focused on corrosive substances, and brought his technical knowledge to bear on his analysis of the bill and set out a number of useful suggestions that i hope will be taken into account as the bill moves into committee, not least the fact that the home office does not collect national statistics on acid attacks, and it would be very useful if it chose to do so. it is important - my hon. friend the member for sheffield, heeley ( louise haigh ) the shadow policing minister made this point in her opening remarks - to review the list of substances that require a licence for purchase, because that will surely evolve in the months and years to come. my right hon.', 'today i am going to address the corrosive substances provisions of the bill and welcome the progress that has been made. had i realised the direction that the debate was going to take, i would have sought to speak for longer and to discuss the wider concerns that have been raised today. i have been seeking a westminster hall debate on those wider issues, and if any other members wanted to join me in trying to secure a debate in the dying days of this term, i would be delighted. last year, there were 85 attacks using corrosive substances in newham and 468 in the whole of london. in the five years since the start of 2012, the number of acid attacks in london has increased by some 600 %, and my constituency is something of a hotspot. this time last year, the fear in my constituency about acid attacks was palpable. i heard about constituents of all ages and backgrounds who were afraid to leave their homes because the perception was that these acid attacks were random. it was a crisis, and it needed a strong response from government. i called for that, as did my right hon. friend the member for east ham ( stephen timms ), and i am happy to see that many of the specific measures i called for are in the bill. most importantly, the bill takes a step forward in recognising that corrosives are just as dangerous as knives. they can do just as much harm physically and emotionally, so they should receive the same kind of legal and police response. the introduction of a clear and specific offence of possession of a corrosive substance in public should make the job of the police and the courts easier in catching and prosecuting those who carry acid as a weapon. the ban on the sale of corrosive products to children is also very welcome.']"

party parliamentary group on prostitution and the global sex trade, of which i am a member, found that sexual exploitation of women and girls by organised crime groups is widespread across the uk. there are at least 212 active, ongoing police operations into modern slavery cases involving sexual exploitation in the uk. our inquiry suggests that this represents just a small fraction of the true scale of organised sexual exploitation."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr pritchard. i offer my congratulations to my hon. friend the member for hove ( peter kyle ) on securing this debate and thank him for his pioneering campaign in bringing this issue to the attention of the house. rogue landlords are taking advantage of the housing crisis by offering rooms, quite openly, for free in exchange for a€œcompanya€ or a€œbenefitsa€ -

they now receive 50 % less funding. the centralised skills system needs to be looked at again, in london and in all parts of england. i will set out the problems seen by us on the all - party parliamentary group for london - and by the all - party group for greater manchester, with which we have done work on this - and the recommendations outlined in our report, a€œbridging the skills gapa€, which i recommend colleagues read. significant steps have been taken since the devolution project started in 2000, but there is a pressing case for specific devolution in this area, and a need to explore ways in which such devolution can be achieved in regions that do not have devolved assemblies or metro mayors.', 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr paisley. i congratulate the hon. member for hornsey and wood green ( catherine west ) on securing the debate. we do not have enough time to cover everything. it has been a fantastic debate, and it is useful for me to hear from individual members. as the shadow minister said, there is a lot of cross - party agreement on the subject. it is not terribly party political. the hon. lady talked about the significant skills gap. i was recently at the world skills competition and conference, and of particular note was that ministers from about 55 countries all around the world were saying the same thing. this is not a uniquely british problem. there is a skills gap around the world. if we look ahead 10 or 20 years, we cannot think of the jobs that will be available. this is a fast - changing climate. to give some background on how serious the situation is, the skills for life survey in 2011 reported that 43 % of people were found to have literacy skills below level 2 - a good pass at gcse - and 78 % had numeracy skills below that level. of the respondents, 15 % were found to have the literacy skills of an 11 - year - old or lower - an estimated 5 million people - and 49 % were at that level for numeracy. therefore, it is estimated that 17 million people have the numeracy skills of an 11 - year - old or lower. according to a 2017 lloyds bank report, 11. 5 million people in the uk are classified as not having basic digital skills. however, increasing numbers of young people are now leaving compulsory education with good standards of english and maths. in 2016, just over 71 % of 19 - year - olds held a level 2 qualification in both english and maths - the highest figure on record.', ""i say with even greater feeling than normal what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, mr paisley. i thank my hon. friend the member for hornsey and wood green ( catherine west ) for securing this debate. her contribution was thought provoking and adds to an ongoing debate on this serious issue. i describe it as serious because successive governments have wrestled with the problem of the national provision and accountability of skills funding and the effectiveness of local delivery. certainly the government ' s own initiative of the apprenticeship levy will not, as far as we can tell at this moment, solve or resolve those historical tensions and problems. we need to look at the issue from a fresh perspective. now is a good time to do that. in the government ' s regionalisation agenda - we talk about the northern powerhouse, the midlands engine and so on and so forth - skills is an essential driver of economic growth in a region. to devolve economic power to the regions without devolving the provision of skills in effect leaves a vital part of economic infrastructure out of regional control. i am here to advocate increased devolution of skills, in particular in an area such as mine, which now has a new metro mayor, andy street, who has pledged to enhance economic growth in the area and to see what can be done with local provision of skills funding in order to enhance the initiatives already in place. nothing could be more appropriate at this time. only last week the local chamber of commerce in my constituency warned of acute skills shortages. my area is the historic black country, which in years gone by was the workhouse of the world, when britain was an international manufacturing powerhouse.""]"

thirdly, how is the uk supporting the church ' s peace - building work in south sudan? the south sudan council of churches has been invited to lead a new peace initiative in south sudan. how can the uk best support those efforts? fourthly, what support are the uk government providing to the ceasefire and transitional security arrangements monitoring mechanism? it is vital that that body is responsive to violations to ensure that perpetrators are held to account. fifthly, what steps are the uk government taking to ensure that the hybrid court is set up as soon as possible in south sudan? tackling the culture of impunity for south sudanese leaders will be crucial in preventing future atrocities. finally, what is the uk ' s view on the current plan of the government of south sudan to hold elections in the near future? it is impossible to imagine free and fair elections taking place in south sudan, and the result risks conferring credibility on the government of south sudan while they continue to commit human rights abuses. in closing, i pay tribute to all the activists and campaigners in south sudan who are rising above the dreadful violence to fight for peace in their country. after decades of conflict, their resilience is truly inspirational.""]"

west makes an interesting point, and i know the minister is listening. it is a travesty that the mother ' s name is not on the marriage certificate. i was not aware of that until i did some research into the debate, and it came as a real surprise to me. it is madness that this has been allowed to go on for such a long time. since 1837, the marriage register entry in england and wales has included details of the spouses ' fathers but not their mothers. there are presently two bills going through parliament that seek to change that inequality, one introduced by the bishop of st albans, which has had its second reading in the lords, and the other by the second church estates commissioner, my right hon. friend the member for meriden ( dame caroline spelman ), which will have its second reading on 23 february. this change has long been called for and has cross - party support. in 2014 the then prime minister gave a commitment that the content of the marriage entry would be updated to include the details of both parents, as current procedures did not reflect modern britain. statistics show that there are currently some 2 million single parents in the country, around 90 % of whom are women. as it stands, if any of their children were to get married, they could include only their father ' s details in the marriage entry. their mother ' s details would not be included. in the modern world, that is unacceptable. i will not touch on the third and fourth elements of the bill. many members have spoken about those elements, including my hon. friends the members for colchester ( will quince ) and for banbury ( victoria prentis ) and the hon. member for washington and sunderland west. i do not feel i can add anything particular, and i look forward to the speeches yet to come on those issues."", ""my hon. friend is impatient. i will confirm that later in my speech : there is plenty more to come. my hon. friend got in first, but it was not really necessary. i am aware that i have majored on the first of the four parts of the bill. it has three other important components, which i think are less complicated and hopefully less contentious. the fact that my late mother could not add her name as a parent on my marriage certificate is an anachronism, well past its sell - by date and, frankly, an outrage. in fact, the signatures of both my mother and my mother - in - law were included on our marriage certificate, but at our discretion, and as the signatures of witnesses rather than parents. my father signed, as did my wife ' s father, because in the days when the anomaly originated, a daughter was a father ' s chattel for him to give away, and literally sign away. that has been the case in england since 1837, the beginning of queen victoria ' s reign, and has not changed since then. the problem apparently lies with the current system of marriage registration, which relies on hard - copy register books held in churches and other religious establishments as well as register offices. that involves some 84, 000 open register books in 30, 000 churches and religious buildings, so it is quite a big undertaking. surely, in this digital age, it is not beyond the wit of man or woman to introduce a single electronic register instead of relying on hard - copy books. that would avoid the potentially costly need to replace all the register books. instead of signing a book at the ceremony, the newly married couple would sign a document that would then be returned to the register office to be entered in the existing electronic register so that an official marriage certificate could be issued, including the names of all the parents."", ""i am pleased to follow my hon. friend the member for faversham and mid kent ( helen whately ) and to have heard her passionate words, particularly about stable partnerships and her experiences in the nhs. i am delighted to support the bill of my hon. friend the member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ). it is a short but packed bill that deals with life and death and everything in between, including a lot of loving. it is therefore a very worthy bill, and i want to turn first to the point about mothers ' names on marriage certificates. i have been married for 29 years, and think a medal is in order - although i am not sure whether it should be given to me or my husband. the whole concept of making a commitment and marrying somebody was a very big decision, and our wedding day was a most momentous day, and our union is forever recorded on our marriage certificate. but currently on our precious marriage certificate there is no reference to my poor mother at all, even though she bore me and virtually died - something she has never stopped reminding me of since. i tell her i was trying to make my presence felt at a very early stage. similarly, when my two daughters get married - if they do - as the law stands, my name will not be on the marriage certificate. one might reflect that that is of no particular consequence, but as my hon. friend the member for erewash ( maggie throup ) pointed out, genealogists and others interested in tracing their family history or the social history of women will be unable to find this kind of information because it is not recorded. that is a great pity, especially as so much progress has been made on women ' s equality.""]"

i will touch on some of the specific points made by my hon. friend in his excellent speech. when he started speaking, i wrote at the top of my piece of paper that the people of essex want to take back control, although he got round to saying that himself. that plays into a much wider debate we should be having about people ' s identity. as a proud member of parliament representing lancashire, i am aware of the strength of the lancashire identity, which in many ways was undermined in local government reform when we lost the city of liverpool, the city of manchester and large parts of greater manchester. there is a real role for members of parliament and local councils in reinforcing those historic county boundaries. my hon."", 'i beg to move, that this house has considered local government reform in greater london. thank you very much, mr hosie, and good morning to all. i am grateful for this opportunity to open what i hope will be a wide - ranging debate on the structure and responsibilities of local government across london and the need to embrace the need for fundamental reform that will better serve the people of this great capital of our nation in the decades to come. i wish to begin a conversation involving both sides of the house with the constituents that we represent. our united kingdom capital of london comprises an amazing patchwork of counties, cities, boroughs, royal boroughs, towns, communities, villages, hamlets and estates. i say a€œlondona€ because that is the name of our national capital - in truth, in 2018, the lines of where london begins and ends are rather blurred. there is in fact much confusion between london as the capital of the united kingdom, where parliament and government sit ; london as greater london, which was how our predecessors decided to construct the shape and boundaries of the city in the 1960s ; and london as a wider region that includes what many people still call the home counties. it is time to reassess whether greater london, as created in 1964 with the formation of london boroughs, or the particular form of london government that was created in 1998 with a mayor and assembly, are fit for purpose in the years to come. we have reached a point where serious reform is needed. i hope all members agree that we should not dismiss change as too difficult to tackle. we have a duty to look at how we can evolve london government to better suit the needs of londoners and the wider region around our capital.', 'i assume the shadow minister is talking about the greater manchester combined authority and the transfer of power up from local authorities to the mayor across the country. in areas of devolution, it has been done by consensus ; he was a leader of one of those local authorities that are now part of the combined authorities, so i guess he would support that. this debate is very important when looked at in the wider context of english devolution. the government will shortly publicise their devolution framework, in which we will talk about what devolution should look like in the rest of england and give a clear roadmap for devolution across england, in compliance with a conservative party manifesto commitment. in london, there is an opportunity to talk about how we might improve the scrutiny and accountability of the mayor of london and of mayors in general. for inspiration, my hon. friend could look to the mayoral model put in place by our government in manchester, where rather than having an additional tier of gla governance, it is a combined authority, with representatives - the leaders of those borough councils - working with the mayor in a collaborative partnership, but with a strong voice for their borough in that relationship. london should look at new solutions like that, on the proviso that they are always ground - up and locally supported.']"

trade in services is broadly in balance. romania is the 18th largest market in the eu for uk exports, and the 19th largest in terms of imports. i can well believe that romania ' s will to continue that trade, in which it has the upper hand, will ensure that a way is found to do that, and that is my hope."", 'i shall come on to the question of the number of people leaving romania and coming to this country in a few moments, but the clear concern in romania is that the young people who leave are not yet returning in any number. they may return in future, and it is true that in certain countries, such as poland, people have started to return and to invest. a number of people who are resident in the uk are investing in romania, but the concern in romania is still about the huge numbers who are leaving and, at the moment, not returning, which puts a great strain on the country. romanians are also concerned about the trafficking of romanian women and children through the european union, including the uk. people are being trafficked for the sex trade and other illicit purposes, such as the drugs trade. clearly that is of concern to the ministry for romanians abroad, and it is one of those areas that we as a parliament need to examine, to ensure that people who come here have chosen to do so of their own free will and accord to contribute directly to our economy, as so many do. equally, tourism and trade provide both a challenge and opportunity. such opportunities will grow dramatically over the next few years. indeed, the deputy prime minister of romania, whom we met on our trip, is married to a british businessman - who i happened to see last week when he was over here. they have been married for a long time. there are also clearly strong economic bilateral relations, all demonstrating the strength of support for the united kingdom and romania. one or two aspects of modern romania and what is happening there are probably not widely known. we visited a number of jewish sites in bucharest. one synagogue is being turned into a holocaust museum, to commemorate and recall the tragic events in romania during the nazi era.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered uk - romanian relations. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, mr betts. i declare an interest, as i am the chairman of the all - party group for romania. i welcome colleagues who were involved in a recent all - party group visit to romania, and those who went there a couple of years ago under the auspices of the inter - parliamentary union. before i talk about the current situation, it is pertinent to review the relationship between our two great countries, which has existed for more than 100 years. our diplomatic relations with romania were established on 20 february 1880, but there was a considerable period, particularly during the second world war and the cold war, when relations were not as friendly as they currently are, so 1990 is considered to be the start of the modern uk - romania relationship. our relationship has grown stronger and stronger over the past 28 years. the united kingdom was a firm supporter of romania ' s joining nato - i will say a bit more about that later - and the european union, and we championed its calls to join both organisations. the strategic partnership that we currently enjoy was established in 2003. last summer, british troops undertook key exercises with romania and other nato allies in the black sea region and the east of romania. our excellent ambassador, paul brummell, noted that it was the busiest period of activity in our bilateral defence engagement in recent memory. that demonstrates our shared history of defence and economic co - operation. our relationship is not limited to our diplomatic or economic relations. prince charles has a sprawling estate in transylvania and visits romania regularly - at least once a year. this year ' s visit coincided with our visit to romania, and many of the key people met him and went to see his estate.""]"

17, local authorities spent a£682 million, or a£29 per household, to keep our streets clean. in addition, highways england spends at least a£6 million a year on collecting litter from the strategic road network. those funds could be better used to deliver the range of important services provided by our councils. our litter strategy, which was published last year, was the first ever for england, and it was produced in partnership with the department for transport and the ministry of housing, communities and local government. we have delivered on a number of key commitments that we detailed, as set out in the annual report, which i assure the house will be published shortly. councils now have new enforcement powers they can use, making it easier for action to be taken against people who litter, principally through the use of fixed penalty notices. the big change has been to make the owner, or more precisely the keeper, of a vehicle liable for littering offences committed from it, although i recognise that this power has already been in place in london councils for some time."", ""i will. we should take pride in the fact that so many members of our communities are prepared to put their own time, effort and hard work into tackling litter. in that regard, i highlight the staff at mcdonald ' s friern barnet, who regularly go out to litter pick. those volunteer efforts are hugely to be welcomed, but we also need to ensure that we have an effective response from the government and local councils. allocation of responsibility for clearing highway litter is governed by the environmental protection act 1990. local councils have that duty in relation to the majority of roads, including trunk roads in the strategic road network. highways england is charged with maintenance and litter clearance on motorways and a small number of trunk roads. similarly, transport for london is responsible for maintenance and litter clearance on several strategic routes in the london region. that means that there are many cases where the body responsible for maintaining the road and its verges is not responsible for litter clearance on those verges. we also end up in a situation where small district councils are supposed to clear litter from busy major roads but are not geared up for the extensive organisation that comes with health and safety requirements, such as coning off lanes or shutting roads altogether, as in the example near my constituency, which i referred to earlier. will the government consider reforming the law to provide that the body responsible for maintaining a road and the roadside is also the one tasked with clearing litter from that roadside? in particular, that reform would mean that highways england had an increased duty to clear the litter around all the roads for which it is responsible, and it would make it much easier to combine work such as trimming roadside vegetation with litter picking, so clearance could take place more regularly and efficiently.""]"

as i said, passenger journeys have increased by 42 % on competitive lines, compared with 27 % on those that have no competition ; revenue has increased by 57 %, compared with 48 % ; and average fares have increased by only 11 %, compared with 17 %. the east coast main line has open access operators such as grand central trains and hull trains. other rail lines around the country would do well to replicate that model. open access operators take no support from the taxpayer. the open access model creates competition on the line, which has led to fantastic results. in fact, since that has been the case on the east coast, the main line has had the highest satisfaction ratings in the country. the east coast open access operators deliver the very highest rates : in 2015 first hull trains and grand central each had a 94 % passenger satisfaction rate, which was the joint highest score of all operators. that was confirmed in 2016 and 2017 in the passenger satisfaction surveys conducted by the competition and markets authority. in 2016, the cma recommended more on - track competition generally, either with much more open access to compete with franchises on the same lines or with multiple operators to provide services in a fully commercial environment. unlike the cma, however, the government are yet formally to declare their support for the principle of extended open access. perhaps the minister will take up the offer to do so this afternoon. open access competition has led to new routes being opened or reopened. without open access on the east coast main line, would places such as sunderland, hartlepool, halifax and bradford have the frequent, direct and high - speed long - distance services from which they now benefit? something similar desperately needs to be replicated in northern lincolnshire.']"

year - old son, who was killed by a 2 - tonne trailer. since the bill was introduced in the house of lords in february, peers and members from all parties have made thoughtful, informed contributions on the complex issues associated with it. we have heard a lot of arguments on proportionality, on bureaucratic burdens, on cost, on scope and on timeframes, but we have also heard about a number of deaths caused by unsafe trailers. i am particularly grateful to lord bassam, who tabled the initial probing amendment on safety in the context of freddie ' s death, and who pressed the government to do what their impact assessment said they would do and seize the opportunity of this bill to improve safety through better regulation. i also pay tribute to lord tunnicliffe for tabling the amendment on report requiring the government to collate comprehensive data on trailer safety and to publish it in a report, for which the noble lords voted. there has been significant discussion and consensus on the gaps and problems in existing information on light trailers and on the degree of threat they might pose. i am pleased that the government agreed in committee to produce a report that includes a recommendation on whether compulsory registration or periodic testing of trailers weighing more than 750 kg should be introduced - that is now part of clauses 20 and 21."", ""it is an honour to follow the right hon. member for south holland and the deepings ( mr hayes ). i will try my best to emulate some of what he tried to say. i welcome the opportunity to discuss the merits of trailer registration and to highlight the rationale and importance of clause 13 ( 3 ), ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) and clause 14 ( 3 ) and ( 4 ), as amended in the house of lords, and i am grateful to the secretary of state for his earlier comments. the subsections require the secretary of state to collate comprehensive data on the number and nature of trailer - related road accidents in the uk, and to include those findings in a report. i welcome that, because the department for transport ' s current reporting methods do not give us a true picture of the risks posed by light trailers in this country. the subsections also give the secretary of state the power to introduce compulsory trailer registration and mandatory testing of trailers weighing more than 750 kg. i accept that as a long overdue step towards improving trailer safety - although it is a compromise - but my work on the issue over the past three years has drawn me to the overwhelming conclusion there ought to be a compulsory register of all trailers weighing less than 3. 5 tonnes, and that they should be subject to regular testing. i shall say more about that later. my interest in trailer safety began soon after i was elected to this place in 2015, when my constituents donna and scott hussey came to see me about their son, freddie, who had been tragically killed in january 2014. three - year - old freddie and his mum were walking along the pavement when a two - tonne trailer came loose from a land rover, sped straight towards freddie, and killed him."", ""i rise to get more clarity and commitments from the minister, specifically on road safety and reducing loss of life. it will come as no surprise to the minister that i will focus on towbar failure and substandard trailers. on the compulsory registration of trailers, i remain concerned that a non - commercial trailer weighing between 750 kg and 3. 5 tonnes can be on the road without being subject to routine safety checks. given that vehicles over 3. 5 tonnes are regularly tested, it seems logical for trailers that are, say, 3. 4 tonnes, or even 1 tonne, to be subject to regular checks. accidents with trailers of such a size could easily cause serious injury or death, as we have heard throughout the bill ' s passage. provision for regular testing would help to shape the behaviour of road users, giving them greater responsibility for the maintenance of their vehicles. some very heavy trailers, perhaps even weighing 3. 4 tonnes, sit off - road without maintenance, potentially for months or years, before being taken on a road or motorway without any formal scrutiny. that presents a potentially deadly risk to road users and pedestrians. the minister has spoken about the opportunity the bill presents for raising public awareness of safety issues. can he provide any detail of his thoughts on what an education and public awareness campaign might look like? i welcome the commitment he has given to extend testing for all trailers over 750 kg if recommended by the report provided for under clause 20, but that does not go far enough. we have an opportunity with the bill to ensure that all trailers over 750 kg are registered on a compulsory basis. such an intervention would help to prevent serious accidents and deaths on our roads. regular checks would increase the likelihood of a culture change, leading to owners of heavy trailers taking more responsibility for the safety and roadworthiness of their vehicles.""]"

or do we want to go back to the british values of welcoming people to this country, as refugees or migrants, because of the contribution that they make to our country? does what the prime minister has outlined sound like the protection of existing rights? my residents in hampstead and kilburn do not think so. i will illustrate my point with the example of two of the 22, 000 eu nationals living there. sarit from hampstead town is an eu doctor. in a year, he does 2, 000 nhs surgeries. he said that brexit is a threat to his work in the uk. i went through a very difficult childbirth two years ago on the nhs, and every single doctor, nurse and midwife who treated me was from the eu. there has been a 96 % drop in the number of eu nurses applying to work in our nhs. georgia, a cypriot constituent, has lived in my constituency since 2003. she wrote to me of her fears about the new reticence of firms in canary wharf to hire eea citizens. the official vote leave statement said on 1 june 2016 : a€œthere will be no change for eu citizens already lawfully residenta€. theya€œwill be treated no less favourably than they are at presenta€. with that clearly no longer the case, we can add the betrayal of eu citizens ' rights to the long list of betrayals that have led to an undeniable shift in public opinion. hon.""]"

it is about creating a balance. i would point out that not all residents in care homes have dementia. many of them do not and have a very strong awareness of their environment. they would see this as an infringement of their dignity - a dignity that they are fighting to hold on to for the remainder of their life. i take the point, but i do not think the issue is straightforward. a point was made about cctv in this building. we accept it, but we do not live here. we accept it in our lives, but if we are to make care homes a genuine substitute home for vulnerable people, we have to bear such points in mind. cctv may have a role in specific circumstances, for example where a concern has been identified, but it ought to be a last resort, implemented only with the knowledge and full consent of residents, families, staff and professional representatives, because this affects everybody, and observing would definitely affect the relationships in the home. acknowledging that it is unlikely that incidents of abuse and poor standards of care would be prevented by installing cctv cameras in communal areas does not mean that serious problems can be ignored. abuse of people in care homes, and / or poor care, shames us all. ln many ways, the issue of cctv is more of a red herring than a solution. i accept that it may have a role in some areas, and there may be justification for using it in some limited ways. however, there is widespread agreement from a range of well - respected organisations that the blanket imposition of cctv is not the answer. as the hon.', 'my right. hon and learned friend has made that point incredibly powerfully and i do not dispute for one second that there is value in that form of monitoring. certain responsible employers might see that value and benefit from it. i still do not think that there is any substitute whatever for top - quality management carrying out that sort of monitoring and surveillance themselves, when done properly. the care act 2014 places a duty on local authorities to promote their local market to ensure that all service users have a choice of high - quality services available. in 2015 - 16, nearly two thirds of service users reported that they were extremely or very satisfied with their care and support, which was consistent with the previous year and is testament to the work carried out at local level to deliver quality services. we cannot rest on our laurels : if two thirds of service users reported that they were extremely or very satisfied, a third did not. that is why the department for health and social care is working with the adult social care sector to implement quality matters, a shared commitment to take action to achieve high - quality adult social care for service users, families, carers and everyone working in the sector. the compulsory use of cctv cameras in the communal areas of care homes would require a change in the law, and it is not clear that that blanket approach would be proportionate or respect the needs and wishes of everyone who lives in a care home. there are undoubtedly cases in which better monitoring of staff would produce benefits, but without fuller evidence, the decision to install cctv should remain one for the care home provider. i have been encouraged by the stories told by my right hon. and learned friend about companies that found that installing cctv brought tangible benefits. i encourage other providers to look at those kinds of examples if they are contemplating installing cctv, and would certainly support them if they wished to do so.']"

it disappeared overnight but i will do my best to say what i can before it gives way. there are a number of shisha bars in glasgow. we counted them up in the office and think there are eight, six of which are in my constituency. we even picked up word that there is a shisha - on - wheels delivery service. i am not quite sure where that would fit in current legislation in scotland or in the uk. it is clear that this is a grey area and that more needs to be done. where there are smoke and mirrors, literally, there is potential for criminal enterprise and issues with building regulations, enforcement and the source of the tobacco, which may enter the country illicitly. a friend, qasim hanif, raised a concern that the tobacco is poor quality and does not comply with regulations, which causes health issues additional to those the hon. member for birmingham, ladywood set out. glasgow adopted the scottish government ' s smoking ban in 2006, and it has been spectacularly well complied with ever since. almost 10 years on, it is unthinkable that people used to smoke cigarettes in bars, restaurants, buses, theatres and cinemas. we have moved on so dramatically from that. the outlier of the regulation has been shisha bars. in december 2012 a shisha bar in my constituency was the first to be prosecuted for flouting the smoking ban."", 'i agree with the hon. gentleman. i am glad to see him here because we missed him very much in the adjournment debate last night. i was going to send out a search party to see where he had disappeared to. shisha bars are gaining popularity among young people who do not drink alcohol, either by choice or because of their religion. there is clearly some demand for that type of space where no alcohol is served, because the options in many town and cities are pretty limited. if people want to go out, they are obliged to be in a place where alcohol is being sold and drunk, but that is not necessarily appropriate for everyone. there is a balance to be struck between the social good, where people can come together in an environment where there is no alcohol, and the harm from smoking shishas that the hon. gentleman points out. the perception that smoking shisha is cleaner and better than smoking cigarettes is a very dangerous myth, particularly for young people. the hon. member for birmingham, ladywood pointed out that one session on a shisha can be as bad for your health as smoking 100 cigarettes. that is quite stark. that information needs to be out there and well known. if the government did more to promote the public health message, that might be useful for many of our communities. the tobacco is usually fruit flavoured and slightly different from cigarettes, which can offer a false sense of security that it is not as bad for you, but smoking it doubles the risk of lung cancer and respiratory illness. it also contains all the factors that we know are harmful about tobacco and it is addictive. because of the way that shisha is consumed, people take other chemicals into their lungs from the heating and burning process. it can be more harmful than smoking. in scotland, business owners need to be licensed to sell tobacco, including shisha tobacco.', 'i beg to move, that this house has considered reforming the regulation of shisha lounges. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mrs main. i am delighted to have secured this debate. in a week in which ministers have been held in contempt of parliament for the first time ever, and we have had ongoing and various crises related to the handling of brexit, talking about the regulation of shisha premises might seem a little niche. i have found myself educating many colleagues about what shisha is and about the problems relating to shisha premises in the affected communities. central to this debate is how we as citizens navigate community life together, balancing the social and entertainment needs of some against the needs of residents, and whether we can take effective action when things go wrong. residents affected by issues relating to shisha lounges, such as those in my constituency and other areas including westminster, brent, ealing, preston, manchester and many of our other core cities, can attest to the fact that, when things go wrong, they face the misery of noise nuisance, crime, antisocial behaviour and everything that goes with that. for them, this is definitely not a niche issue. it affects communities profoundly. i should explain what shisha is and what form these premises take. shisha, which is also known as a water pipe, hubble - bubble smoking or a hookah, is a way of smoking tobacco through a bowl and a pipe or a tube. the tobacco is often mixed with other flavours such as mint, coconut or pineapple - i have seen every variety going. the tobacco is burned, and then the vapour or smoke passes through a water basin before inhalation. it is a social activity ; people do it in groups.']"

she has started a company called tip tap, a mobile phone app that will allow diners to give their tips directly to the waiter. they can pay the bill to the restaurant, the waiter will get out their app and then they can pay the tip to the waiter directly. that seems an example of a good solution, but i still do not quite understand why restaurant owners and others feel it is a particular hassle to facilitate that process for their workers, who are often the lowest - paid in those businesses - as i say, on average, they earn only around a£7. 71 an hour. this is a simplistic debate ; i think waiters and waitresses should get 100 % of their tips."", 'i beg to move, that this house has considered the regulation of tipping practices in the hospitality sector. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir roger. a few months ago, a local newspaper in bristol, the bristol post, exposed a tipping practice at a local chain of restaurants called aqua italia that involved managers levying a 3 % charge on all table orders regardless of tips received. in practice, that meant that waiters and waitresses could, on occasion, be asked to go to the cashpoint after their shift to withdraw their own money to pay the levy to their employers, even if they did not have any tips themselves. those funds were then recycled to help pay the wage bill - in essence, charging workers to work. amazingly, i am told that that is apparently legal - that is, if, in a reference period, such as a weekly pay period, the average hourly wage after deductions does not fall below the national minimum wage, it is legal, but if it does fall below the national minimum wage, it is not. that is because there are no useful laws on the regulation of tips in the hospitality sector or, as in the case of aqua italia, on charging workers to work. enforcement can happen only if it is related to the national minimum wage. that seems an enormous loophole that should be closed, because this is an issue not only at aqua italia. as the bbc a€œinside out westa€ investigatory team found in its documentary, it has been happening at other restaurants too, including the national chain turtle bay, which has a restaurant in bristol. the offensive practice of charging workers to work and the exploitation of low - paid hospitality workers through an abuse of power in the use of tips is not new news.']"

joint enterprise has been applied in cases for more than 300 years, although it is a common law that has never been passed by parliament. the doctrine allows for more than one person to be charged for the same offence, despite the fact that they may have played a different role, or no role, in the crime. joint enterprise applies to all crimes, but in recent years it has been particularly used as a way to prosecute murder, especially, but not exclusively, in cases involving groups of young men. this is obviously a very emotive issue, particularly for families of murder victims, and no one is suggesting that those who commit murder, or who knowingly and intentionally assist in committing murder, should not face the full force of the law. however, nor should the evidential bar for serious offences like murder be lower, by virtue of presence or association with the principal offender, as we have all too often seen. indeed, there are many cases, many of which i am sure will come to light today, in which people are serving life sentences when it is clear that they did not commit murder but were found guilty under the a€œolda€ or a€œwronga€ law of parasitic accessory liability.""]"

ops face in investing in social housing. unless co - operatives can raise additional capital, they cannot expand or develop to their true potential. at worst, they are at risk of demutualisation, as i will set out. co - operatives do not issue shares in the same way as investor - owned companies - to do so would mean demutualising - so bigger co - operatives can face considerable difficulties raising additional capital at the level they need. their growth inevitably is limited and their ability to compete on equal terms is reduced. in short, legislation is needed to fix this problem - legislation that protects that unique governance model of co - operatives, but allows them to issue permanent investment shares. such shares could allow consumer co - ops to grow by acquisition and by developing new business offers for their customer members. football supporter - owned clubs could fund the development of new stadium facilities, grow their businesses, serve their communities and consolidate their income streams. co - operative - owned energy generators could attract long - term investment to build even more energy infrastructure of the sort we need in this country. a lack of capital limits a co - operative ' s growth and ability to develop new services. the growth rate of that co - operative is constrained by its relative inability to add significant capital through retained earnings."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered capital needs of co - operatives. it is a privilege to serve under your chairmanship, sir david. it is a particular delight to be able to talk co - operatives with the treasury minister twice in two days. for those of us who want the co - operative and mutual sector of our economy to double in size, fixing the difficulties that co - operatives have in accessing the capital they need to expand is critical. co - operatives uk, the co - operative movement ' s trade body, has done an excellent job in recent years of championing community shares as one way for local co - operatives to raise significant but comparatively small amounts of capital to grow. lottery money is currently being used by co - ops uk ' s community share unit to support community shares offers, but more could be done if the government renewed their previous interest in this area. it would be good for ministers to explore what else they can do to encourage the further expansion of community shares. more recently, co - ops uk, working with retail co - op societies, has begun to explore whether fixed - term withdrawable share capital could be developed, allowing more established societies to raise patient and engaged equity finance from members and non - member investors, up to a a£100, 000 maximum individual shareholding limit. the financial conduct authority does not always get a good press, but it has been very supportive of that work, and i hope the minister will encourage the fca and co - ops uk to continue to champion that new potential source of capital for many co - operatives. the chief executive of co - ops uk, ed mayo, deserves praise for his skill in getting this work so far down the road."", ""my hon. friend raises a good example of the difficulties that co - operatives face. i pay tribute to his work championing the co - operative he mentioned. he also underlined my point about the good work that co - ops uk has done in championing community shares. his fundamental point is absolutely spot on : there is a limit to the amount of capital that co - operatives can raise because they do not have the instruments available to them that are available to many of the non - co - operative businesses that operate in our economy. like all businesses, co - operatives need to be able to benefit from the economies of scale that are often available only by growing their businesses. they need to gather sufficient capital to serve their members well, to extend services to new members and to expand their services. without new capital, many co - operatives could be driven into inappropriate corporate forms through demutualisation. many of us in the co - operative movement can think of many examples where that has already happened. if co - operatives convert to other corporate forms, consumer choice in our economy is reduced and large numbers of consumers would no longer have non - listed, member - owned options in the marketplace. that reduces competitive pressure from the operation of different business models in the same market and adds to systemic risk to the economy. there is inevitably a limit to the amount of debt that can or should be raised by any business. mutual shares would present an opportunity for small mutuals to raise funds that they may not be able to raise otherwise, and for larger co - operatives to raise funds that subordinated debt does not provide. additional capital helps in a number of ways. it could be used in tactical acquisitions, which would help businesses ' competitiveness. they could also look at local infrastructure development potential. there are a number of examples overseas of similar co - operative share offerings.""]"

i voted to remain ; and i was one of only three labour mps with leave seats who voted against triggering article 50. i feared that the government had no idea what they were doing. i feared that they would call a general election and waste valuable negotiating time, and so it came to pass. let us not forget that that election was intended to crush the saboteurs. members were called luddites and people who wanted to disrupt democracy. however, the election did not crush the saboteurs."", ""i am glad we are having this debate. it is often demanded of this house on international matters and in negotiations that we back the prime minister of the day, but 78 years ago this month the labour party did the unimaginable : in the early stages of the second world war, when we were fighting for national survival - arguably a bigger issue than brexit - we voted against the then conservative prime minister neville chamberlain and we drove him from office. at the time, the labour party was led by one of this country ' s greatest ever leaders, clement attlee. our decision in may 1940 to force a division in this house on what was dubbed the norway debate, because it related to the allies ' campaign to stop the german invasion of norway, led to the resignation of neville chamberlain. at the time, we were attacked for being opportunistic, undermining the prime minister, and being devious and divisive. we were told by conservative members that this was not the right time, at such a dangerous moment, to a€œsnipea€ at the prime minister. the times called it a€œa great misfortunea€ that we did what we did. the criticisms being levelled at us now, for scrutinising what the government are doing on brexit, are similar in tone. looking back, that moment in 1940 is celebrated. it led to a new government of national unity, led by winston churchill and clement attlee, which helped to see off the nazis. brexit is clearly a very different situation : it is not a decision about war and peace, life and death, but it is surely the gravest issue to face this parliament in more than 50 years. given the importance of the issue we are dealing with, no one who sits in this house - i say this to the hon.""]"

it sets the parameters of the new single market relationship we want to achieve, and it leaves options open to achieve that. i urge all members on both sides of the house to support it. let me turn to the question of human rights and other protections. lords amendment 4 sets out enhanced protections for employment, equality, health and safety, consumer standards, and environmental rights and standards. the argument is very simple ; it was very simple at the start and it is very simple now. at the moment, these rights have enhanced status because we are members of the eu. they are being converted into our law - the government said they would convert them and they are converting them ; i will come on to the charter of fundamental rights in a minute - but not with any enhanced protection. all the amendment says is that if those rights and protections are to be changed, that should be done by primary legislation. the amendment is not contentious, and it does not even say that the government cannot change those rights. it just says that if they believe in these rights and think they should have enhanced protection, they should for heavens ' sake put them into a form that means that if they want to change them, they have to use primary legislation to do so."", ""the situation is set out in detail in the written ministerial statement that we laid. both houses will have meaningful votes on whether to accept the agreement. it is my expectation that we would not ratify before that primary legislation has gone through. new clause 1 was tabled by the labour front - bench team. it seeks to place limitations on the use of existing and future powers to amend and modify retained eu law. it is absolutely right and necessary for existing domestic powers granted by parliament in other acts and any future delegated powers created after exit day to be able to operate effectively and without inappropriate fetter within uk domestic law after our departure from the eu. this includes parts of our existing domestic law which will become retained eu law after exit day, as well as retained direct eu legislation which will be converted into our domestic statute book. the bill ' s current approach to existing and future delegated powers aims to ensure the successful operation of retained eu law within our domestic statute book beyond the time limits for the bill ' s more limited specific powers. adopting the new clause, on the other hand, would undermine the position of certainty and have several detrimental effects that would risk creating significant confusion in the uk statute book. first, limiting the modification of retained eu law by existing and future delegated powers only to when this is necessarya€œto maintain or enhance rights and protectionsa€could have uncertain consequences. a test of necessity would impose a high burden that may prevent powers from being used in the most appropriate and relevant way if the regulations they create are not deemed truly necessary for the protection of rights. that could mean that existing and future delegated powers would be unable to amend or modify irrelevant or unsuitable parts of the statute book, leading to ossification of parts of retained eu law within uk domestic law and creating confusion and uncertainty."", 'i cannot give way, because i really must press on. we are committed to proper scrutiny and engagement with parliament and the public on our corrections to eu law and future changes. in addition to all the changes we have already made to the bill, there will be a presumption in favour of engagement or consultation where it is proportionate and sensible to do so. of course, departments will consult where there is a statutory duty to do so. departments across whitehall have already undertaken engagement or consultation with stakeholders for active discussions on areas where that has been proportionate and sensible, and that will only increase. most of those who have supported lords amendment 4 are well intentioned, but some must have known that it would have hugely detrimental effects on how we could deliver a functioning statute book ahead of our exit and in the future. instead of protecting the law in the crucial areas of employment, equality, health, consumer standards and environmental protection, it would weaken it. by calling this amendment a€œenhanced protectiona€, some are seeking to hide a great danger. by limiting the changes that delegated powers could make to retained eu law relating to the specified policy areas to only those that are deemed technical, the amendment would fundamentally limit our ability to properly correct deficiencies. that risks dramatically increasing the amount of primary legislation that needs to be enacted ahead of our exit, putting more pressure on this place ahead of brexit. even the changes deemed to be a€œtechnicala€ enough to be achieved through delegated powers would still face a lengthy enhanced scrutiny process, which the lords could force to be as long as the 18 months required for legislative and regulatory reform orders. in other words, our statute book could not be made ready for exit by 29 march 2019.']"

party support, crucial amendments were made to it that have addressed many of those flaws. i pay tribute to my colleagues in the other place, as their amendments will benefit the consumer - the public - and that is what this bill should be all about. first, we tabled an amendment - to be frank, it is astonishing that this was not already part of the bill - to ensure that one of the core objectives of the single financial guidance body will be to protect consumers.', ""i beg to move, that the bill be now read a second time. the bill will reform the current financial guidance service landscape to improve outcomes for people in their everyday lives. it will bring about two changes. first, it will restructure the financial guidance landscape for members of the public by creating a new single financial guidance body and providing funding to the devolved authorities for locally commissioned debt advice. secondly, it will move the regulation of claims management services from the ministry of justice to the financial conduct authority. both measures will benefit members of the public and provide a sustainable legislative framework for public financial guidance and the future regulation of claims management companies. ensuring that people, especially those who are struggling, are easily able to access free and impartial financial guidance to help them to make more effective financial decisions and to improve their confidence in dealing with financial service providers is an important step towards improving people ' s financial capability. in addition, ensuring that people are able to access high - quality claims management services speaks to the government ' s commitment to ensuring that action is taken when markets work against consumer interests. the provisions in part 1 of the bill follow three consultations, conducted by the previous conservative government, on the provision of pensions and money guidance and the provision of advice on debt management. in particular, the consultations examined the demand for such services, how their provision should be structured and how to make that provision more effective for consumers. the final consultation revealed a broad consensus for a single body for financial guidance. as a result, the bill will bring together the important work done by the money advice service, the pensions advisory service and pension wise to create a single financial guidance body. the relevant measures have received strong support from industry, stakeholders, charities and consumer groups."", ""i am pleased to speak in support of this bill, which is of real significance to my constituents, given the demography of east renfrewshire. i refer members to my entry in the register of members ' financial interests. prior to coming into this place, i spent nine years as a specialist pensions advisory solicitor and i was a member of various fun organisations such as the association of pension lawyers - it is, i assure members, as exciting as it sounds. part 1 of the bill creates a single financial guidance body to replace three existing services. it is a much - needed move to make public financial guidance more accessible and more integrated. the services offered by the money advice service, the pensions advisory service and pension wise are somewhat disjointed, and there is a lack of communication and co - ordination between the three services. that is why only 3 % of pension wise users say that they first heard about the service from the money advice service, for example. as we are talking about public financial guidance services, those figures should be much higher. that is why it is important that the three services are replaced with one body. instead of having to contact two or more services for different aspects of financial guidance, people will be able to access one integrated and holistic service. it is absolutely critical that people across the uk can access independent, impartial and high - quality financial guidance. it should go without saying that the ultimate measure of a guidance service is whether the guidance it provides is useful. i would, therefore, like the single body to be subject to rigorous evaluations based on consumer outcomes, not just outputs, to ensure that it is fulfilling its role. much of the anticipated success of the new sfgb assumes that the new body publicises itself effectively. according to which? around two thirds of people are aware of each of the three existing bodies.""]"

indeed, it is a national asset of the first order. the hon. lady ' s constituency and mine lie at the heart of the project to deliver growth, jobs and prosperity in redcar and cleveland, which centres on the former steelworks site. there is no downplaying the social and economic magnitude of the closure of the steelworks in 2015. everyone on teesside felt the consequences, and everyone on teesside was devastated for the workforce and their families. the closure was not their fault ; the truth is that the headwinds confronting steelmaking at redcar were strong and kept blowing in. the mothballing of the site was announced in 2009, and after ssi reopened it in 2011 it made a loss in every subsequent year of operation. amid the desolation that followed liquidation in october 2015, the government made a promise, which i am proud to say is being honoured. that promise was that a new beginning would be made on this iconic site, underpinned by huge government support to secure and remediate the land, and anchored in private sector - led growth and investment."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the future of the former steelworks site in redcar constituency. it is an honour to serve under your chairmanship, as always, mrs moon. i pay tribute to all colleagues who are here to support this debate. the former steel site in my constituency has huge implications for the entirety of the tees valley, so i am pleased that colleagues from both sides of the house are here to work towards the future of the site. as someone once said, we are all in this together. regionally, locally and nationally, it is vital that everyone does their bit to ensure we build up from the devastation three years ago and get our communities back on their feet. the site is the key to the future of the tees valley economy. i secured this debate to draw attention to the biggest opportunity for new industry and jobs in the uk, and hopefully to send a strong message to investors around the world that the tees valley is open for business and has the government ' s full support behind it. the south tees development corporation site covers almost 4, 500 acres on the south bank of the river tees. it was once the beating heart of industry, with shipyards, blast furnaces and chemical works lining its banks, and employed tens of thousands of people at its peak. on a visit to teesside during the 19th - century boom, william gladstone observed : a€œthis remarkable place, the youngest child of england ' s enterprise, is an infant, but if an infant, an infant hercules. a€those booming, herculean years sadly did not last forever. although the area is still home to many successful businesses, its industrial footprint is significantly reduced and employment opportunities are much fewer.""]"
