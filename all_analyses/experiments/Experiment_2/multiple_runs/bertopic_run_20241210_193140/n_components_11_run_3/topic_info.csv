the prime minister was right to talk about hard truths, because the british people, whether they voted leave or remain, will not thank politicians who deliver a damaging brexit on the basis of a false prospectus. the former prime minister john major was right, too, when he said that it is right not only to speak truth to power, but to speak truth to the people. let us face up to the hard facts : there will be no brexit dividend for public services, as the chancellor confirmed again on tuesday ; there will be no significant change to migration ; there are no real red lines on the european court of justice ; and there will be huge damage to the economy, according to the government ' s own analysis. it does not have to be like that.""]"

it was really disappointing to hear that travellers who were forced to get rail replacement buses at short notice were sometimes turned away because the buses were full or simply did not turn up. that is even more ironic considering that arriva also operates overlapping bus groups. that just highlights the farce that is going on at the moment. we know that late - running network rail projects reduced the time available for train operators to plan the new schedules, but what assessment has the secretary of state made of his department ' s culpability in this, with regard to network rail? despite assurances that all was well, it is now clear that there was no possibility of the timetables being capable of being operated in full from day one. why did no one in the train operating companies, network rail or the department for transport ask for a postponement of the new timetable roll - out? the secretary of state has said that he will take the strongest enforcement action against gtr if it has broken its franchise agreement. will that action be stronger than that taken against virgin trains east coast, which has been allowed to walk away owing the department for transport billions of pounds? what is the secretary of state ' s exact timeframe for resolving these timetable issues? he has mentioned putting in additional resources. what additional resources will be put in from his department? what is he doing to ensure that the driver shortage is not met by poaching drivers from other franchises, which could have an impact on services elsewhere? on the question of compensation, what will he do to ensure that the rail industry does not recover the costs of compensation from other fare - paying passengers?""]"
1,1011,1_homes_housing_planning_affordable,"['homes', 'housing', 'planning', 'affordable', 'land', 'build', 'houses', 'buyers', 'built', 'building']","['we are all agreed : the uk has a housing crisis. no matter which party is speaking, there is universal recognition of the desperate need to urgently increase the supply of housing. so there is no debate, then, is there? the global financial crash had a catastrophic impact on the house building industry in this country. given that much of the credit crunch was down to bad debts, particularly those resulting from bad lending in the us domestic housing market, this was perhaps to be expected. in just two years, the number of homes built crashed by 30 %, and with this the supply of housing just dried up. that economic shock forced the then labour government to drive for affordable house building as part of an economic stimulus programme to help the country through the deep recession. by 2009, the foundations for a new era of affordable house building were laid, with a a£4 billion annual affordable housing programme, backing for councils to receive grant funding and build new council housing, full localisation of council housing finance agreed with the treasury to boost building still further, and a programme of progressively higher standards agreed with industry to make all new build homes zero carbon by 2016. it was a comprehensive programme. since the change of government in 2010, public policy has been perceived as at best indifferent and at worst hostile to affordable housing. one of the first decisions made by conservative ministers after the 2010 election was to cut back new housing investment by more than 60 %. as a result, the number of new government - backed homes for social rent started each year has plummeted from almost 40, 000 to fewer than 1, 000 last year. the number of new low - cost ownership homes being built has halved. the plans that labour left to get councils building 10, 000 homes a year were undermined, dashing any hopes of councils being able to build at scale again.', ""it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for grantham and stamford ( nick boles ), although i did not agree with everything he said. he and i know each other very well, and it is good to see him back in the house. we constantly hear the same lines about the government promising to fix the housing market, yet after their seven years in government, it is no secret that we still have an enormous housing crisis in this country. last year, the number of affordable homes built in this country fell to the lowest level in 24 years. new policies introduced by this government have weakened the previous labour government ' s brownfield - first policy. in fact, under this government, as of july 2017, 425, 000 homes were planned to be built on green - belt land. that represents the biggest yearly increase in proposed development on green - belt land for two decades. to add insult to injury, since 2009, only 16 % of houses built on green - belt land outside local plans were deemed affordable. it is worth pointing out that under the previous labour government, 2 million more homes were built and we had 1 million more householders owning their own homes, but since 2010, under this government, the number of homeowners aged under 45 has fallen by 900, 000. there was also the biggest investment in social housing for a generation. on average, labour councils have built around 50 % more homes than tory councils since 2010. it is clear that the government ' s housing and planning act 2016 fails to get to grips with the crisis of home ownership. it is simply no good trying to twist this around and placing the blame on those in local government. if that were true, coventry ' s local plan would not have been approved by this government."", 'my hon. friend makes some important points. i am looking forward to the midlands pilot of the housing association voluntary right to buy scheme and to renewing and reinvigorating our commitment to right to buy in that sector. we have been consulting with local authorities and housing associations on their views, and those will be fed into the social housing green paper. of course, the measures i have already announced will also help to make a difference in enabling councils to deliver new homes. helping local authorities to increase council housing is, of course, only part of the story. that is probably where i differ slightly from the hon. gentleman. we are also implementing a range of other measures to increase the supply of homes across the board. whether those homes are for rent or for ownership, and whatever the sector, it is the overall supply of new homes that will reduce unaffordability over time if we get it right. to ensure that we could deliver that, housing was front and centre of the autumn budget, which made available more than a£15 billion of new financial support for house building over the next five years, bringing the total support for housing to at least a£44 billion over the period. that was the biggest budget for housing in decades. more money was announced for infrastructure : we almost doubled investment in the housing infrastructure fund to a£5 billion and promised an additional a£400 million to regenerate rundown areas. as the hon. gentleman probably knows, warwickshire has benefited from both the viability funding and the forward funding - millions of pounds for extra infrastructure to help authorities to build those extra homes so that we do not just build more homes, but build up our communities. we also gave more help to small and medium - sized builders. on planning reform, we have revised the national planning policy framework, which has gone out to consultation.']"

they trooped through the lobby to take away scotland ' s powers - theresa may ' s poodles, whipped to vote against scotland ' s interests. scotland was aghast. the actions of the uk government have been an affront to democracy."", ""i am grateful to the hon. gentleman for his intervention because i am about to speak about wales and about other people. the right hon. member for ross, skye and lochaber said that the people of scotland are watching. they are watching, but does the snp know what they are saying? they can see the grievance politics of the snp. they will come to their own conclusions about why the snp scottish government have ignored the scottish parliament ' s presiding officer, who has said that its continuity bill was outwith the remit of the scottish parliament. the scottish public will have to wonder why the snp does not accept the concessions from the uk government that have met with the approval of the welsh assembly and of welsh labour. the snp told us that it was hand in glove with the welsh government in these negotiations, but all of a sudden, with concessions from the uk government, we have agreement in unionist wales, but not in separatist scotland. the people of scotland have to ask why labour and liberal democrat peers are wrong when they say that the devolution settlement will be respected. many of those peers are the architects of devolution itself, yet they can agree with what the uk government are putting forward. the public in scotland will also have to ask why the snp thinks that lord sewel is wrong. the man who gave his name to the convention we are discussing today says that he backs the uk government position. lord sewel has said today that he backs what the uk government are doing, which is respecting the devolution settlement of our country. yes, the people of scotland are watching, and they see the snp working in the nationalist interest rather than in the national interest. i want more for scotland : i want scotland to get more powers from this uk government, and that is what is happening."", 'i really, really hope that people in scotland are watching this. a conservative member from south of the border who failed to be elected in scotland says, a€œall heart. a€ this has nothing to do with heart - this is about the rights of the people of scotland who voted for devolution and are finding that the uk parliament is taking away their rights in the teeth of opposition from the scottish parliament and every single party there, with the exception of the scottish tories. when will the scottish tories begin to listen to the people of scotland? this is not about the snp. this is about the scottish parliament. this is about the people of scotland. let us not forget that the conservatives have lost every single election in scotland since 1955. they have been defeated - yes, you can see - look at the 13 who have been elected. there are 35 of us here from the scottish national party, which won the election for scotland. that is the reality. the conservatives are in a minority administration in parliament. they would love to have the majority of mps that we have from scotland, but it is not likely to happen. we have defended the sentiment time and again, and we are here to do so again. a€œwhy today?

the same number of respondents also reported a significant increase in the number of litigants in person in family cases. most worryingly, however, 25 % of respondents had stopped doing civil legal aid work, and 48 % of barristers surveyed did less legal aid work than before. we know about legal aid deserts popping up across the country. almost one third of the legal aid areas in england and wales have one local legal aid housing advice provider, or none. laspo has shunned those who most need help.', 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir christopher. i thank the hon. member for westminster north ( ms buck ) for bringing the debate. i acknowledge her work, as others have done, as chair of the all - party parliamentary group on legal aid. i am delighted to have the opportunity to respond, because legal aid is an important part of our legal system. it is fundamental that individuals have access to justice - the ability to determine their rights in a fair and impartial way - and, as the hon. lady said at the beginning of her speech, legal aid is an important part of the process for those who cannot afford to pay for legal representation. before i address many of the important points made, i want to make three points, which concern the amount of money we have invested and continue to invest in legal aid, the recent steps we have made to expand the scope of legal aid, and the significant investment we are making in our justice system, which will assist all litigants more broadly. first, on spending, it is important to recognise that the government spend a£1. 6 billion a year on legal aid, which is a fifth of the ministry of justice budget. that is in addition to other sources of funding to ensure justice and the fair determination of rights. for example, in the last three years we have spent almost a£6. 5 million in addition through the litigants - in - person support strategy to help people to navigate the legal process. secondly, in recent months the government have increased the scope of legal aid in a number of areas, as the hon. member for hammersmith ( andy slaughter ) kindly highlighted. in january, we broadened the accepted evidence for domestic violence and removed all time limits.', ""before i turn to the particular instances that affect the hon. lady ' s halifax constituency, it is important to make a number of broad points about access to justice and the courts estate. in every sector, digitalisation is improving access to services, including to public services. technology has reformed the way that we live our lives and made many processes more efficient. in such circumstances, we ask ourselves whether justice should be immune from digital advancement. in 2015, the civil justice council wrote a report, stating that online dispute resolution had enormous potential to bring two great benefits to our justice system : a lower - cost court system and an increase in access to justice. the ministry of justice is now in the process of improving and upgrading our justice system to bring it up to date in the 21st century. technology is not the only answer to any upgrade. the provision of justice depends on people and courts and on lawyers and judges. however, in circumstances in which 41 % of courts in 2016 - 17 were used at less than half of their available hearing capacity ; in circumstances in which the money from the proceeds of the sale of a court are put back into the justice system ; in circumstances in which we are spending a£1 billion on our courts reform programme ; and in circumstances in which finances are not unlimited, we do need to ask ourselves where money on the justice system is best spent. it is in that context that the closure of the courts in calderdale took place. the closures of the county and magistrates courts were proposed because they were poorly used. for example, in the financial year before the consultation, the magistrates court had been used for 33 % of its available hours. both the magistrates court and the county court were also grade ii listed buildings and not fit for purpose. the court consultation resulted in a proposal to move the work to bradford, where better facilities were available for those using the courts.""]"

there is also a wider concern.', ""it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for stoke - on - trent north ( ruth smeeth ), who gave a splendid exposition of the issue we face in the country and clearly showed her dedication to her constituents. the number of members present is testament to how important this debate is. given the extent of bank branch closures, it is likely that we all have an interest in this issue because of what is happening in our own constituencies. in the past 25 years, the uk has seen the closure of nearly 10, 000 bank branches, which is over half of all of them. the rate has accelerated, with more than 600 branch closures in the past year. it is right that we should embrace technological change, but the rise of new approaches, including online banking, means that we are faced with the decline of traditional banking. many customers have a preference for in - branch banking. they prefer face - to - face service and the chance to talk to people, to get financial advice, to access their money physically, and to have the security of seeing their bank transaction take place and of receiving a paper record to prove it. in recent times, against a backdrop of scandals, one of banking ' s redeeming features has been the personal relationships that banks still offer to customers. members of the community often struggle when a bank closes, and closures are particularly important for elderly or vulnerable people who may not use online banking. in recent years, my constituency has suffered from the closure of several local banks. like other members, i am sure, my constituency postbag and inbox have swelled as a result. in may 2016, lloyds bank earmarked its branch in woodley precinct for closure as part of a cost - saving measure."", 'i pay tribute to my hon. friend the member for east lothian ( martin whitfield ) for his important and impressive speech earlier and for calling this debate. i do not want to speak for long, but i do want to say a few words about the importance of restoring faith and trust in our financial institutions. recent weeks have brought bad news of further bank closures in scotland and across the united kingdom by rbs. three of the targeted branches are in my constituency, in stepps, tannochside and bellshill. we are continually told that branches are being closed because more people are banking online, but what about the disabled, the elderly and others who want to open a new account? i accept that many people bank differently these days, but i take issue with the speed at which change is being forced through and the damage it is doing to communities along the way. i ask rbs, if it is watching, to think again. its closure programme is affecting the worst - off and most vulnerable in my community and many others, as we have heard today, but rbs will never understand the frustration that customers across scotland and the united kingdom feel at these bank closures. stepps will be a town with no bank at all. that is unacceptable and speaks to the financial isolation and exclusion that can be triggered when these decisions are taken. i mention all that because our small and medium - sized businesses are going to think twice before seeking to borrow from these financial institutions, and we cannot blame them - not when these banks are prioritising themselves and their profits over the communities they should be serving. they are putting profit before people.']"

it is a humanitarian catastrophe. since august 2017, nearly 680, 000 rohingya refugees have sought shelter in bangladesh. there have been some suggestions, including by the foreign affairs committee, that the uk failed to see this crisis coming. with respect, i disagree with such a conclusion. let us be clear about what has led to this current situation. the rohingya have suffered persecution in rakhine for decades. such rights as they had have been progressively diminished under successive military governments. they have been victims of systematic violence before, most recently in 2012 and in late 2016. on these more recent occasions, the rohingya fled their homes - some to internally displaced person camps elsewhere in rakhine, and some to other nations over land or sea. the outbreak of vicious hostility during the past six months is therefore only the latest episode in a long - lasting cycle of violence. we have been urging the burmese civilian government to take action to stop the situation deteriorating since they came to power two years ago. what was unprecedented and unforeseen about this most recent violence was its scale and intensity.""]"

on effect of all these claims is increased insurance premiums, particularly for young people and the elderly. as members across the house will know, for many people, owning a car is not a luxury, but a necessity. that is especially true of those in rural communities, but it does affect all our constituents. that is why we have pledged in our manifesto to tackle these costs. taken together, the whiplash measures proposed by the government could result in savings of around a£1. 1 billion a year. around 85 % of the uk motor and liability insurance market have publicly committed to pass on those savings to consumers.', 'it is a pleasure to be able to speak in this debate on the second reading of the civil liability bill, which brings forward changes that are of great importance to the insurance industry. i am pleased to hear that there has been significant engagement between industry and government over this essential legislation. ageas insurance, for example, is one of the largest providers in the uk, employing more than 400 people in my constituency, and it has communicated to me its enthusiastic support for these changes, shared by the vast majority of the public. these measures will help to reduce motor insurance premiums for insurance customers by adjusting how the personal injury discount rate is set. alongside this, the introduction of a new tariff will specifically target exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims that have driven up insurance premiums for hard - working households in places such as stoke - on - trent. a new fixed compensation level for whiplash injury will be created, putting provisions in place for the court to uplift the compensation available in exceptional circumstances, compared with a final compensation figure being negotiated by the parties involved, as is currently the case. the compensation culture that has been created, with huge levels of unjustified claims for things like whiplash, saw premiums rise at the fastest rate ever last year. increases of about 10 % a year are totally unmanageable and unaffordable for motorists. these changes must be brought about to reduce the price all motorists are having to pay to compensate unreasonably high levels of claims. clearly, it is important that these savings are passed on to consumers. i am pleased to hear that the abi, which represents 93 % of the motor insurance market, has written to the lord chancellor emphasising its commitment to this.', ""i am sorry, but given the time constraint and the fact that many other members want to speak, i will crack on. during my latter years as a broker, i saw the attitude change. exaggerated claims were often seen as a a€œvictimless crimea€, and as being okay, because the insurance industry would pick up the tab. although the amounts of compensation paid for soft - tissue claims are relatively small, the associated claims - handling costs - including the costs of investigation, processing, lawyers ' fees and medical reports - are disproportionately large. for example, a claim for about a£1, 000 may ultimately cost the insurer two or three times that amount. it is clear that fraudulent claims have a direct impact on the cost of every one of our constituents ' motor insurance premiums. given an average of about 60, 000 vehicles per constituency, there is a considerable cost. according to the association of british insurers, for every pound paid out in compensation, nearly another 50p is then paid to the claimant ' s lawyer in costs. the bill gives us an excellent opportunity to fix the current broken system, a system that is not working for millions of motorists throughout the country. it will bring about long - overdue reforms of personal injury compensation. it will provide a fairer system for claimants, insurance customers and taxpayers by creating a more proportionate compensation system in the case of both whiplash -

one of the many effects of the housing crisis is the sheer amount of people now forced into the private rented sector. it is for this reason that i am adamant that we must improve conditions for renters. the liberal democrats have fought long for renters ' rights, so i welcome and support this bill. it is vital that we in westminster ensure that tenants ' fees are abolished because of the transient nature of the private rented sector, particularly for young people. however, the housing crisis has also pushed many families into renting and, as we heard earlier, the leading cause of homelessness is the ending of a private rented sector tenancy. while rental costs continue to spiral, people are becoming trapped. they cannot afford their rent, but nor can they afford to move because of the myriad administrative fees. we must ensure that the bill fully ends the practice of tenants ' fees. however, as the bill is currently drafted, there are still loopholes around default fees. the secretary of state ' s amendments go some way towards closing the gap, and ensuring that letting agents and landlords do not introduce new fees under a different name. however, the text of the bill is still too ambiguous, leaving what constitutes a reasonable cost to the discretion of landlords or letting agents. we must also provide local authorities with appropriate funding to enforce the ban. if local authorities have no resources to enforce it, landlords and letting agents will just continue with this unreasonable practice. i urge the secretary of state to listen to the concerns raised today. otherwise he will undermine legislation that could really make a difference to people ' s lives. there is little merit in introducing legislation with obvious loopholes that allow individuals to continue with a practice that we want to stop."", ""it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for walsall north ( eddie hughes ). like him, i refer the house to my entry in the register of members ' financial interests, as my partner and i rent out properties, although we are also private sector tenants. i wish to congratulate the government on introducing this bill. i was proud to be elected last year on a manifesto to increase rights for tenants, although any bill should protect the role of good and ethical landlords too. unfortunately, rogue letting agents have for too many years been allowed to profit from insecure tenancies, with some charging renewal fees every six months. nearly all charge administration and referencing fees, and huge deposits, which are completely out of reach for low - income families. i support the broad aims of this bill, but i would like to draw the government ' s attention to one aspect that continues to leave tenants vulnerable to unfair fees. i have particular concern with schedule 1 ( 4 ), which reserves the right for landlords and letting agents to charge tenants who are forced to default on their tenancy agreements. i believe people who rent through the private sector could be better supported by this part of the bill. i understand that some agents and landlords currently charge a full month ' s rent for tenants to be granted an early release, then every month ' s rent and utilities while a new tenant is found. there are genuine instances where tenants are forced to end tenancy agreements, which they entered into in good faith, through absolutely no fault of their own : for someone living in the private rented sector who is made redundant from their job, benefits might not cover the rent, and any delays in receiving benefits will leave them in rent arrears. someone might have had a family bereavement and might need to move to another part of the country or of the world.""]"

and we should, to get to the point where we do not send our plastic elsewhere to be recycled because its being recycled here has a value for our economy, as the hon. member for blackley and broughton ( graham stringer ) said. clearly, we would all love that to happen. i also acknowledge the recent budget announcement of a new tax on the manufacture and import of plastic products that do not contain at least 30 % recycled plastic. that is another important message from the government, and it shows that they are taking the issue seriously and seeking to introduce solutions. i turn to the specific issue of plastic packaging for fruit and vegetables in supermarkets. the petition rightly points out that it can be incredibly difficult for consumers to avoid purchasing items packaged in plastic, especially in the fruit and vegetable aisle. it is all too common for people to accept the fact that all our fruit and veg is wrapped in plastic, but several hon. members present will admit to being old enough to remember when that was not the case. that our fruit and veg comes in a plastic wrapper is a relatively modern development, which we have accepted. it is right to challenge that now. we do not have to accept that norm : there could be alternative ways to reduce the amount of plastic used to package our food. we have to strike the right balance, however. we do not want our desire to decrease plastic packaging to create another problem by increasing the amount of food waste produced. that is where innovation and other types of packaging that can protect and preserve our food should be encouraged and would be hugely welcomed.', ""the reality is that until now, china, turkey, malaysia, indonesia, vietnam and other countries have largely been happy to accept our plastic because they have seen it as a raw material that they can use to generate more products. plastic recycling is technically possible and exists in this country already - it is just that it is not as economical. people have to pay to recycle various sources of plastic rather than getting a benefit from them, although that is changing. we recognise that china has reduced the amount of contamination that it is prepared to accept in plastic - it does not ignore all plastic, but effectively it has closed the market and made it less worth while. i am sure my hon. friend is eagerly awaiting our strategy on resources and waste, which will appear in due course. perhaps more can be revealed at that time. i mentioned the measures in the 25 - year environment plan we published in january, as well as the government ' s commitment to taking action against the problem of single - use plastics waste as part of our wider strategy. we have given a£20 million to the plastics innovation fund, which is co - ordinated by innovate uk and the engineering and physical sciences research council, and which aims to reduce the environmental costs of plastic and litter. i am pleased to say that, in the budget, we announced not only a tax on plastic products that are not at least 30 % recycled, but a further a£20 million of funding : a£10 million extra for r & d and a£10 million to pioneer innovative approaches to boosting recycling and reducing litter. the fund will be made available during the 2019 - 20 financial year. i agree with my hon. friend the member for north cornwall that innovation is vital in supporting developments to tackle plastic waste, so we will continue to explore commercially viable options."", ""i agree with the hon. gentleman that complexity is part of the challenge. supermarkets can help by ensuring that as much as possible of the plastic packaging they use is recyclable, and that if it is not, it is clearly labelled accordingly. that would help households and consumers to make informed decisions. consumers are key to the process. the government can perhaps do more to reduce plastic waste from food packaging, but ultimately consumers will drive change by making informed choices and by making the responsible choice - whenever they are given a choice - of the option with the least amount of packaging, and of plastic - free packaging if possible. many supermarkets have sought to take action. i believe that much of that has been driven by consumer choice and by consumers ' desire to reduce the amount of plastic packaging, and we should welcome that. in september, lidl announced that it would cease to use black plastic packaging on fruit and vegetable products by the end of that month. as we know, recycling black plastic is challenging. morrisons, the fourth - largest uk supermarket chain, announced in april that it will bring back traditional brown paper bags for its fruit and veg aisle as part of a range of measures to cut plastic waste. i am sure many of us read the reports over the weekend that a north london supermarket is the first independent supermarket in the country to introduce plastic - free aisles, and is now calling on others to follow its lead. there are signs that retailers are starting to get the message that consumers want less plastic waste from their food packaging. i encourage all consumers who feel strongly about this matter to continue to drive home that message. i believe that there is a role for the government, but most of the change will come from the consumer. the introduction of the 5p charge for plastic bags shows that the government can nudge people to make the right choices.""]"

secondly, to reassure the workers employed on public service contracts that they will continue to get paid for their work ; thirdly, to make sure that the right support is in place for pensioners ; and fourthly, to protect taxpayers from an unacceptable bail - out of a public company, the risk of which is rightly borne by the shareholders and the banks that have lent to it. the situation today is that the official receiver is now effectively running carillion, and in the course of time his investigations will show exactly how the company ran into trouble. although carillion was under some financial pressure from three uk public sector construction projects - two hospitals and a road scheme in scotland - it is already clear from the company ' s statements to the stock market and from information that has become public since the liquidation that the problems it faced lay largely in its overseas construction projects and in the level of financial risk that it took on.""]"

value tariffs. that will help to protect the 11 million households on low standard variable or default tariffs who are not protected by existing caps. as hon. members have said, the difference between the cheapest tariff and the average standard variable tariff from a big six supplier is about a£300 a year, and it has been at about that level for the past six months. that is an awful lot of money for constituents in some of the poorest parts of our region, as well as others in the uk. the competition and markets authority ' s recent investigation into the energy market found that the domestic customers of the big six energy suppliers pay on average a£1. 4 billion a year more than they would in a truly competitive market. i do not think that there is any argument in the house about the fact that the market is not truly competitive. although i believe that promoting competition is generally the most effective way to ensure that customers receive the best value in their service, i welcome the fact that the government are prepared to act when it becomes apparent that markets are not working for consumers. as colleagues have said, the technological advances that will improve the market are not happening fast enough to support vulnerable people now. the government made a manifesto commitment to extend the price protection that is currently in place."", 'quite unsettling, yes. i believe that pressing for an absolute cap over a relative one is the right way to go. as the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee stated, a relative cap could force cheaper energy tariffs to disappear, harming consumers, not protecting them. that would run counter to the sentiment of the bill. as we have heard, ofgem will be given the task of making the cap work effectively with its formula and will be responsible for setting the cap and reviewing it every six months. as outlined by my hon. friend the member for weston - super - mare ( john penrose ), it is beholden on ofgem to get this right and hold people to account, otherwise it will not have been worth while. it is vital that energy companies do not take advantage of any price cap and lift their tariffs to the maximum allowed. as i mentioned earlier, the energy sector needs more price competition to encourage lower prices, and an absolute cap can help to achieve this. i am delighted that the government will require the gas and electricity markets authority to protect consumers beyond the end of the energy price cap. energy companies must not slip back into their old habits as soon as the cap is lifted, putting ordinary people back in the position they were in before the cap and leaving them paying over the odds. the bill will ensure better value for money for many people who, frankly, have been taken for a ride and been paying over the odds for the self same energy that the person down the road has been getting cheaper. as the minister stated, it cannot be fair that between 2012 and 2015 customers paid a£1. 4 billion more than they ought to have done. in 2016, this escalated to an incredible a£2 billion. as i have said before, many of these people fall into the a€œvulnerablea€ category.']"

frankly, we expected something more radical, more substantial and certainly with more funding. no amount of gloss can hide the significant problems with the approach to drugs policy that the government have taken since taking power in 2010 : it has been ideological and plagued with irresponsible cuts. all the members in the debate have expressed the truly shocking scale of the problem. the uk has the highest recorded level of mortality from drug use since records began. there are record numbers of deaths from morphine, heroin and cocaine use. there are more deaths from overdoses than from traffic accidents, and there is an ever - increasing incidence of hiv and hepatitis transmitted via unhygienic injecting. drug consumption rooms have operated in europe for three decades, most notably in countries that have had greater success in reducing drug deaths than we have. even if the government are misguided and will not look at evidence from other countries, i would have thought that they would have taken the advice of their advisory council on the misuse of drugs. in 2016, in response to the unprecedented drug deaths, it recommended that the government consider the introduction of drug consumption rooms. i believe the response was : a€œit is for local areas in the uk to consider, with those responsible for law enforcement, how best to deliver services to meet their local population needs. a€i agree that the local authorities are best placed to deliver such services."", 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mrs moon. i congratulate the hon. member for inverclyde ( ronnie cowan ) on securing the debate. it will soon become apparent that i disagree with large parts of what he has said ; in a democracy it is quite correct that we can take two sides of the same argument. however, i agree that the effects of drug use, and the deaths caused by it, have an impact on each and every one of our constituencies. drugs and drug addictions are among the worst scourges of our society today. according to the national treatment agency for substance misuse, the cost to the uk economy of drug misuse is more than a£15 billion a year. far more importantly, drugs destroy lives and livelihoods, tear apart families and communities, and fuel crime and exploitation. although the number of drug users is falling, the number of people dying or being admitted to hospital due to drug use is on the increase. in scotland, it is nothing short of a crisis. the rate of drug - related deaths in scotland is considerably higher than in england and wales. it is estimated to be the highest in europe, yet every year the number of deaths hits a new record high. the same goes for hospital admissions. in 2016 - 17, the rate of people being admitted to scottish hospitals in relation to opioids, cannabinoids, cocaine, and sedatives and hypnotics reached new records. the crisis can and will get worse. the county lines operations, which the hon. member for inverclyde mentioned and which are spreading across the uk, bringing a supply of drugs to rural communities across the country, are particularly concerning for me as a member of parliament for a rural constituency.', ""i congratulate the hon. member for inverclyde ( ronnie cowan ) on securing the debate. the uk does not operate alone, and neither do global drugs control policies. the uk government, as a fully paid - up member of un treaties, must acknowledge and take ownership of the failure of global drugs control policies and the harms that are done in its name - the so - called war on drugs. it is actually a war on the people who use drugs, because it is they who feel the sharp end of prohibition. some 26 countries have made changes to domestic laws and policies concerning the possession of illicit drugs for personal use in order to protect their citizens, but the uk lags behind. it is not really a war on drugs ; it is a war on citizens ' behaviour, and it is most often delivered by the state against the poorest people and communities. we do not put drugs in prisons ; we put people in prisons. we allow the market to regulate itself because we simply prohibit drugs. it is a market, and it will not go away or be managed by simply investing in more police or in border control efforts - it is like trying to make gravity illegal. we cannot be naive and seriously think that there is any way forward but to reform policies to make them fit for today. that brings me to the long - standing issue of the glasgow safer drug consumption facility and heroin - assisted treatment pilot project, which has cross - party support in the city, certainly from labour and the scottish national party. as hon. members might be aware, the issue of drug use and drug - related mortality in glasgow is particularly acute. it is a problem that necessitates radical and disruptive new approaches. almost a third - 267 - of scotland ' s drug - related deaths in 2016 occurred in the greater glasgow and clyde health board area.""]"

i ask because the number of applicants from england aged 18 decreased by 12 % between 2016 and 2018, while the number of applications from those aged 25 and above from england fell by 40 % in the same period. furthermore, a decline in the number of mature students affects specialist areas of nursing such as learning disability and mental health. in all areas of nursing, not having enough nurses means that the safety of care is a concern - it could become fundamentally unsafe. frontline staff are compromised, and people seeking to access health and care services are not able to receive the quality of care that they need. nursing students spend 50 % of their time in clinical practice and - as mentioned by my hon. friend the member for ipswich ( sandy martin ) - nursing courses run longer than many other degrees, which means that nursing students have no opportunity to take on part - time work to supplement their income. they deserve support that recognises the exceptional nature of nursing and we need to invest in their future. if we do that, we would also be investing in our nhs and, indeed, in england. it is clear that student nurses work long hours, which demands much from them. this can be physically, mentally and in many cases emotionally draining. it is particularly difficult when a student nurse witnesses, for example, a newborn baby dying on a paediatric ward, or when they are caring for terminally ill patients or those with complex mental health needs. if the government consider that training and the nhs worthy of recognition, when will they properly invest in student nursing careers?', 'i could not have put that as clearly as my hon. friend has. i am glad that student nurses came and explained the situation to him, because that is the very reason why we are having this debate. with the last bit of control that they have kept since the reform, the government fund clinical placements, but they do not match the numbers to the volume of routes that they have created. they made nursing students, apprentices and nursing associates all compete for the same places. they did choose to fund, but it was not enough. now it is a blame game full of finger - pointing. if there are so many people interested in becoming nurses and such high levels of vacant posts, why are the government not doing more to convert the applicants into nurses? i expect the minister will say, a€œwe have introduced new routes to expand the number of nursing staff. a€ there are nursing degree apprenticeships that few people are taking up, because employers do not have enough cash to release people to study. nursing associates, who were introduced in a supporting role to the registered nurse, should never be a substitute for registered nurses. these efforts have been small and unpredictable. most importantly, they have not addressed the heart of what grows the number of nurses safely and at scale : higher education. this is workforce panicking, not workforce planning. i expect the minister will say, a€œthis government have grown the number of nurses working in hospitals, a€ which is factually true, but distorts the truth that the overall number of nurses has only grown by less than 1 % since 2010. while there are 7 % more nurses in acute settings, there are 6, 500 fewer nurses in the community, 43 % fewer district nurses, a quarter fewer school nurses, nearly 5, 000 fewer mental health nurses and 40 % fewer learning disability nurses.', 'the hon. lady makes a fair point. training needs to be provided to all staff, but absolutely, those who are not exposed to such people are a particular issue. my comments so far have been decidedly non - partisan, and i hope members from across the house are able to support most of what i have suggested. however, before concluding, i must make some observations about the staffing pressures that affect our public services - particularly changes to student nursing bursaries. we have heard in the house many times that the current financial settlement for student nurses is insufficient given the intensity of their courses. i and many others believe that nursing students need bespoke financial support if the government are to meet their commitment to growing the nursing workforce. those students need support for living costs to incentivise a wider range of applications. there are many ways that can be done - through universal grants for students in recognition of their placements, means - tested grants to maintain diversity or targeted support for parents and carers, as many nursing students come to university later in life. since the coalition government came to power in 2010, specialist areas such as learning disability and mental health nursing have been the worst hit by the wider staffing crisis. those specialties struggle to recruit, since mature students are particularly likely to choose them. the royal college of nursing reports that there are 40. 5 % fewer learning disability nurses - 2, 176 fewer full - time equivalent nurses - today than in 2010. despite government claims, the removal of the nhs bursary in england failed to increase the number of nursing students. recent data shows that the number of students accepted on to nursing courses in england has fallen by a further 4 % in the past year, and by 8 % since student funding was removed in 2016. intelligence from rcn regional networks indicates that directors of nursing across england are escalating concerns about course provision.']"

and, therefore, my department - for the hearing that occurred on 8 november last year, it is the case that there may well have been information that should have been included in the dossier and that was not provided, but it is worth pointing out that it is the responsibility of the parole board to satisfy itself that an offender is no longer a risk to the public. the judgment of sir brian leveson was that the parole board failed to probe that evidence sufficiently, as it should have done. i reiterate that the national probation service opposed the release of john worboys. i made no secret of the fact that i was considering whether to take a judicial review, and i set out in my earlier remarks the reasons why i did not bring that forward. the reality was that the victims were in a better position than me to bring a successful case. it is important that we ensure that when the parole board reaches a conclusion that meets certain criteria, there is an ability for it to look again and examine whether the relevant panel has performed its duties as it should have done.', ""with permission, mr speaker, i wish to make a statement on the high court judgment handed down this morning in the case relating to the parole board ' s decision to release john radford, formerly known as john worboys. this is an important and unprecedented case. the president of the queen ' s bench division, sir brian leveson, the most senior judge who heard this case, said that it is wholly exceptional. it is the first time that a parole board decision to release a prisoner has been challenged, and the first time that the rules on the non - disclosure of parole board decisions have been called into question. the judgment quashes the parole board ' s decision to release worboys and finds that rule 25 of the parole board rules is unlawful. this means that worboys ' case will now be resubmitted to the parole board. a new panel will be constituted, and updated evidence on his risk from prison and probation professionals will be provided. the panel will then assess anew whether worboys is suitable for release. those victims covered by the victim contact scheme will be fully informed and involved in this process. my department also has to reformulate the parole board ' s rules to allow more transparency around decision making and reasoning. it is clear that there was widespread concern about the decision by the parole board to release worboys. as i have previously told the house, i share those concerns and, consequently, i welcome this judgment. i congratulate the victims who brought the judicial review and reiterate my heartfelt sympathy for all victims who have suffered as a result of worboys ' hideous crimes. i want to set out, in greater detail than i have previously been able to set out, the reasons why i did not bring a judicial review."", ""i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement on today ' s high court decision. today ' s unprecedented ruling, made possible by the human rights act, clearly highlights the deep flaws in the initial parole board decision. that initial decision clearly caused anguish for the victims - those whose cases have been dealt with - and also for those who have not yet had justice. in addition, there has been deep concern among women and the public more widely. the head of the parole board has decided to stand down, but what is needed is real change in the way that the parole board functions. the current legal restrictions on the parole board mean that we do not know why the initial decision was taken. that led to a rumour about where worboys would be released, and even a rumour about his being released without a tag. that is not good for victims, and it is not good for public confidence. it cannot be right that women victims had to go to judicial review before the reasons for the release of john worboys became available. we also remember the government making the victims go to the supreme court to secure compensation following police failings. judges in the judicial review said that too much secrecy about parole board decisions under rule 25 of parole board proceedings prevents any reasons from being given for decisions made by the board. therefore, as has been mentioned, the worboys ' case underlines once and for all that there is a need for the government to take urgent action and urgent measures to guarantee greater transparency in parole board decisions. given that the public are entitled to be informed about court judgments, they must also be entitled to be informed about the clear reasons behind parole board decisions. of course, this is not about undermining the independence of the parole board, and we on the labour benches will defend the independence of our judiciary.""]"

in my view and, i think, all our views, it is even more important to the united kingdom because of the connectivity for the east of england. research from the brilliant essex chamber of commerce, a great champion of strategic infrastructure improvements across essex that has campaigned and worked with the business community, has shown that 56 % of essex businesses that responded to its survey regularly use the a120. only the a12 at 82 % and the m25 at 72 % were used more than the a120. however, the government know, and have heard not just from me but from successive members of parliament from the east of england over the last decade and more, that the a120 is not fit for purpose. it needs investment to unlock future economic growth and jobs. the a120 is also a dangerous road.']"

we need to create these designated areas. i pay tribute to the football supporters federation and supporters direct for their persistent campaigning to get recognition for the voice of fans. it is not about recreating areas where clubs can cram people into a standing area ; this is about creating rail seating where someone will stand in the place of a seat.', ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr robertson. i shall try to make some comments while ignoring the taunting of the portsmouth fan on the opposition benches to my right - although it is difficult to ignore. if we want to see who is successful in football, we need only note that southampton has survived in the premier league again this year, while pompey languishes somewhere closer to the sunday leagues. all - seater stadiums have been required by law since 1994. there were good reasons for introducing them, but i think that now is the time to consider whether we can have safe standing as well as seating. safe standing has been trialled and is now accepted as being safe. in 2011 the scottish premier league relaxed its requirement for all - seater stadiums and celtic, as has been mentioned, now has a safe standing space for 3, 000 supporters. next season, league one team shrewsbury town will join celtic and have its own safe standing area. the stunning st mary ' s stadium in southampton has a capacity of more than 32, 000. frequently 32, 000 fans attend to watch - unlike at portsmouth, not far down the road. the saints moved from the iconic dell ground in 2000. we used to stand on the terraces until the move to the new stadium. many football fans want to continue to stand, and southampton fans are no exception. fans in the northam stand all too often still stand, although by law they should not. that presents the club with a difficult decision about how to police the situation ; thus far it has not managed to do it. however, the situation proves that safe standing, even in an environment where there is standing between seats, has been safe for some 18 years at southampton football club."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr robertson. i want to thank the chair of the pompey supporters trust, simon colebrook, for talking with me about the issue, as well as our excellent shadow minister, my hon. friend the member for tooting ( dr allin - khan ), who has led our party in backing safe standing across the football league. i thank, also, the owner of portsmouth football club, who has written to me about this important issue today. in a debate about safe standing in championship and premier league games, pompey fans will be painfully aware that, despite a prolific history of european and top division football, not to mention multiple fa cup wins, our club are currently enjoying a short break from the pressures of the premier league. nevertheless, our time in this country ' s top two divisions means that, under current legislation, we are required permanently to remain all - seater. our club is therefore a prime example of the injustice of the government ' s stance on safe standing, because in reality the issue is not whether to bring safe standing into football grounds ; it is already there. when portsmouth fans travel to the grounds of bristol rovers, peterborough united, wycombe wanderers and countless other sides in the football league, they see stadiums where fully licensed standing sections are operated. yet back at fratton park they have no choice : standing sections are not allowed. that is all because we previously spent more than three seasons in the top two tiers. i must admit that i am puzzled about why the government think standing becomes safer as the quality of football gets worse. if that is true, southampton fans should not be made to sit. why should divisional status - and historical divisional status, at that - have implications for whether clubs can have standing sections at their grounds?""]"

the services that children in need relied on - have fallen prey to the government ' s austerity programme and are disappearing. in that environment, in any organisation, the roles and responsibilities that have the weight of legislation behind them - the things that absolutely must be done - are always the ones that take prominence. there is no legal requirement for local authorities to continue to support children in need when they turn 18, so it should come as no surprise that those children, on the cusp of adulthood, fall into the abyss. looking at the current figures for 16 and 17 -

it is a huge priority for her and for her government. survival rates have never been higher, and they have been increasing year on year. of course the prime minister celebrates that, but it is also why she announced a very ambitious package of measures for cancer care and treatment, showing that cancer will be absolutely central to the long - term plan for the nhs, which she has challenged nhs england to write before the end of this year and of which i will say more later. we are committed to investing an extra a£20 billion a year in our nhs. the investment will build on the success we have already achieved through the implementation of the cancer strategy for england. i pay tribute to harpal kumar and those at cancer research uk who put that strategy together. we will build on that legacy and take it forward into the long - term plan. in opening the debate, the hon.', 'it is an absolute pleasure to see my hon. friend in his place. long may he stay there. cancer is, understandably, a very emotional topic. one in two people in the uk will be affected by cancer in their lifetimes, and, as we have heard from almost everyone who has spoken today, we have all been affected in some way ourselves. when my children were very small, i lost my mother - in - law to breast cancer. that is one of the reasons why i joined the all - party parliamentary group on breast cancer, and i am vice - chair of the group to this day. it is this emotion that encourages us and gets us all to come together to tackle cancer. over the years, there has been a steady improvement in cancer survival rates in england. however, we still lag behind the improvements of our european counterparts, and the number of new cancer cases continues to rise year on year. if these trends continue, it is estimated that by 2020 some 2. 4 million people in england will have had a cancer diagnosis at some point in their life. that is why the government must take urgent steps so that cancer diagnosis care and outcomes in england can be improved. the cancer strategy was a welcome step forward to achieving the best cancer care and outcomes in the world, and labour is fully committed to delivering, and helping to deliver, that strategy in full. however, as has been mentioned, there are some concerns across the house about the progress of the strategy. i am pleased that some of the targets have already been met, but i am under no illusions - many are no closer to being reached than they were almost three years ago.']"

a place that sees us regain confidence in the values we bring as a nation that upholds the rule of the law and individual freedom ; and a place that encourages technological and scientific advance.', ""if i may, i will make some progress, as i am now running out of time, having tried to address a number of the issues. my right hon. friend the member for east devon made strong points about the issues around estates. we have discussed this in the past, but i have to say that i think all of us regret the idea that the embassy building in bangkok had to be sold off. one rather hopes that having lost bangkok, it will be the last of such sales. as he is well aware, a considerable amount of that money is being reinvested in improving our estates across the world. i have to say, i have not heard in any way the issue he raised about the paris chancellery. as for the eeas people being sent back by the fco, i will try and write to him in some detail on that. i believe that a well - directed, properly funded diplomatic service is vital to delivering the united kingdom ' s overseas objectives at such a crucial time. the world today is more complex, challenging and costly than at any point since the end of the cold war. at the same time, we are striving to deliver a positive, hopeful, optimistic and, i still hope, a successful exit from the eu, while simultaneously turning our vision of global britain into reality by increasing further our already significant international reach and influence. it is no underestimate, however, to say today that the uk faces - i agree with my right hon. friend the member for mid sussex - its greatest diplomatic challenges in decades. this government are absolutely committed to ensuring that the diplomatic service receives the resources it needs to support a resilient and adaptable network, with sufficient capacity to respond decisively to fresh priorities and challenges. this includes exploiting the inevitable opportunities that will arise in a post - brexit world.""]"

when i see him, i know my political compass is pretty much on message. there are some great elements to the bill, and the first i would like to touch on is that of civil partnerships. it is always worth remembering in this place to follow the evidence and look at the background of the case, and i want to touch on some of the evidence base. civil partnerships were introduced in 2004 to allow same - sex couples to obtain legal recognition of their relationships and access to the same legal rights as opposite - sex couples. in the first 10 years, 64, 000 people took up civil partnerships, according to the office for national statistics figures. the marriage ( same sex couples ) act 2013 meant that same - sex couples can marry under english and welsh law, and from the end of 2014, civil partners were granted the right to convert their civil partnerships into marriages. following a consultation in 2012, no changes were made to civil partnerships under the 2013 act. the government argued at the time that civil partnerships were created to allow same - sex couples equal access to the rights, responsibilities and protections for those who are married. in 2014, another consultation was launched to gather views and evidence on the future of civil partnerships. almost 11, 500 people responded, with a huge range of views. since that, there has been a legal case, which sits behind this bill. in 2016 a heterosexual couple presented a case to the high court arguing that they faced discrimination under present law. the case had much wider implications, and the judge granted the couple permission to take it to the court of appeal. the hearing took place in november 2016 and the judgment was delivered in february 2017. all three judges said that the claimants ' human rights were affected, but concluded by a majority that it was proportionate for the government to take time to decide the future of civil partnerships."", ""i echo the support that has been expressed for the bill, which will ensure the registration of stillbirths before 24 weeks and give coroners the power to investigate stillbirths. i will concentrate on the clauses that address civil partnerships. i stress that i understand the case that hon. members have made today, and i applaud the passion of my hon. friend the member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ) for this topic. although i welcome a report and a review to find more evidence, i think that rolling out civil partnerships to everyone is not the right approach, as i am confident such a review would highlight. it is time to refresh our minds as to why civil partnerships were invented. they were invented because same - sex marriage was not legal. civil partnerships were not intended to be a permanent alternative to marriage. they were created to allow same - sex couples access to rights, responsibilities and protections equivalent to those afforded to married couples. that is no longer the case. i appreciate and empathise with the argument that the current situation is unequal because opposite - sex civil partnerships are not available, but the answer is not necessarily to expand civil partnerships. in fact, i would rather see civil partnerships cease altogether. today everyone in the uk can get married. we finally have equality, which is what people have campaigned for and fought for. expanding civil partnerships to all would serve to add an extra tier, which would confuse and complicate commitment, rather than encouraging it. let us also be clear that there is no legal difference between marriage and civil partnership. the differences are in the names, in the ceremonies and the fact that women are, of course, named on their children ' s civil partnership certificates, but we can address that separately - i passionately believe in naming women on their children ' s marriage certificates.""]"

we take them away from their environment and put them somewhere separate, where they generally respond much better. if people have committed crimes, they should have that impingement placed on them. the use of that technology should be denied them. i think that the purpose of the bill - i did not serve on the public bill committee, so i stand to be corrected on this - is to strengthen safety and security in prisons, through the authorisation of interference of public communications. in 2016 the government published plans for reforming the prison system, including the measures in the bill. the a€œprison safety and reforma€ white paper set out the government ' s plans to deliver a mix of operational changes and to underpin the legal changes required. our prisons face significant security challenges. in 2016, approximately 13, 000 mobile phones and 7, 000 sim cards were found in prisons - an incredible number. that was an increase of 7, 000 mobile phones from 2013."", 'the hon. lady is quite right, and i will go on to explain how mobile phones are used to continue crime in our prison service. to reiterate, last year 23, 656 mobile phones were found in our prisons, which is nearly 65 a day. in my constituency, 184 mobile phones and 80 sim cards were found at hmp lewes last year, and having visited the prison regularly and met prison officers and the governor, i have heard at first hand the implications of that. as the hon. lady pointed out, illegal mobile phones present a serious risk to the security of our prisons, as well as to public safety. mobile phones in prisons are used for a range of criminal purposes, including commissioning serious violence, harassing victims, and continuing involvement in extremist activity and organised crime. access to mobile phones is strongly associated with drug supplies and violence in our prisons, so it is a serious problem. it might be argued that the prison service should be better at stopping mobiles entering our prisons in the first place, but as the previous justice secretary made clear in a speech to reform in december last year, technological advances have been harnessed by some manufacturers with the clear intention of circumventing prison security measures. technological advances have made it possible to manufacture phones so small, and containing so little metal, that they can be concealed internally and are difficult to detect with existing screening machines. phones have been marketed as a€œbeat the bossa€, which refers to the body orifice security scanner that is in use in our prison receptions. however, just as technology can be harnessed for illicit ends, we can also enlist its support to improve the effectiveness of our response to the problem. public communications providers such as mobile phone operators have been at the forefront of rapid technological developments in mobile communications.', ""this welcome bill goes some way to addressing the issues surrounding mobile phones in prison, and as my hon. friend the member for west ham ( lyn brown ) said, evidence has shown time and again that mobile phones have been smuggled into prison for use by inmates, often to enable them to engage in further illegal activity. they are used illicitly to order drugs, harass victims, and organise crime, both inside and outside the prison. the use of phones for such activities is completely unacceptable, but figures indicate that the number of phones conveyed into prisons for use by inmates is increasing. the hon. member for lewes ( maria caulfield ) gave some figures, and i shall present some others that show a similar trend. in 2013, there were around 7, 500 reported incidences of mobile phones and sim cards being found in prison, but by 2015 that figure had increased to nearly 17, 000. mobile phone use in prisons is a problem that needs tackling, and the bill is a welcome step forward. i might question whether back benchers should be driving forward legislation to tackle illegal prison activity, rather than the government, but nevertheless the ability to interfere with wireless telegraphy and to disrupt mobile phone use in a designated, specified area could have a significant impact in reducing the use of mobile phones and, subsequently, any further illegal activity through their use. although the bill goes some way to addressing organised violence and drugs in prisons, it cannot be seen as a panacea to end the problems in our prisons. violence, drugs, and further crime are not helped by the government ' s treatment of our prisons system, which has produced an environment that allows them to flourish. the government ' s decision to slash prison budgets, axe prison officers and neglect our prisons has led to overcrowding and violence.""]"

changing injuries in the line of duty. their service and sacrifice has not been in vain. as i saw when i visited back in march, not only do millions of ordinary afghans now have access to clean water, vital medicine and education, which would not have seemed possible less than 20 years ago, not only have they enabled the afghan people to take charge of their own security, and not only is the capability of the afghan national defence and security forces growing, but elections are giving a voice to the people of afghanistan, who are increasingly calling for peace, which would have been unthinkable a short time ago. our commitment to afghanistan remains an enduring one. although uk combat operations ended in 2014, our troops are playing a key role in nato ' s resolute support mission by leading the kabul security force. they are performing a vital role in training, advising and assisting the afghan national army and air force and developing the nationwide security structures that will strengthen afghanistan ' s democracy. they have a quick reaction force that works alongside the afghan army to provide urgent help in kabul if and when required."", 'the hon. lady raises a very serious issue. the terrorist attack that she refers to was indeed appalling. as she said, too many victims lost their lives as a result of that attack that took place in afghanistan. it is important that we ensure that we are providing support, as we do through our contribution in afghanistan. that is a contribution to security in the kabul area specifically from our forces, but it is also about working with others to ensure that the afghan security forces are able to provide security and safety for all communities living in afghanistan. tremendous achievements have been made in afghanistan today, compared with the situation before these efforts, but sadly, as the hon. lady highlights, too many terrorist attacks are still taking place in afghanistan. we will continue to work with our allies and the afghan government to prevent these in future and to ensure that people can go about their daily lives in safety and security and with confidence.']"

it does not apply to the other sites under hes contractual arrangements with the trust. the hon. gentleman asked whether the waste was being secured safely. the answer is yes ; the environment agency has been inspecting the situation. the issue is the overstorage of waste, not that the waste is not being stored in a safe manner. well, that is the legal remit of the environment agency, which is an independent body.', ""as i set out in the written statement published this morning, on 31 july the environment agency notified central government of an issue concerning clinical waste disposal. the primary concern was that too much waste was being held by a contractor, healthcare environment services, in a number of waste storage and treatment sites. this included waste collected from hospitals and other public services. although the waste was stored securely, it was not being disposed of within the correct regulatory timescales. the department of health and social care, the nhs, the department for environment, food and rural affairs, the environment agency and the cabinet office have worked together to resolve the issues. our priority throughout has been to ensure that proper measures were put in place to enable trusts to continue to operate as normal. a major part of the contingency plans concerned commercially sensitive contractual discussions with hes and other providers. following the environment agency ' s partial suspension of hes ' s normanton site, which came into force on 3 october 2018, nhs improvement wrote to hes to raise its concerns. nhsi gave hes an opportunity to set out how it was complying with its legal and contractual obligations ; hes failed to provide that assurance. as a result, 15 nhs trusts served contract termination notices on sunday 7 october. as part of our contingency arrangements, we ran a tender process with the clinical waste sector before awarding a new contract to mitie. as contracts with hes were terminated over the weekend, mitie stepped in and, from monday morning, provided continuing waste collection and incineration across all of these organisations. in september, officials from the department of health and social care visited each of the major trauma centres affected and confirmed that waste was being stored correctly and that contingency plans were in place. in addition, visits have been undertaken to each of the sites by the environment agency this weekend and this week, alongside earlier visits.""]"

victims must always feel that the justice system is on their side. when a member of the public comes forward to report a crime or to give evidence in court, they must be treated fairly and with compassion. when all is said and done, we must do our utmost to ensure that victims receive the justice they deserve. what is needed is a victims ' law, which the 2015 conservative party manifesto pledged to introduce ; the minister will find that pledge on page 59."", ""that is a very good point, well made, and i hope that the minister will address it in his remarks. as i was saying, our criminal justice system must ensure that it has the rights of victims of crime at its heart. when it fails to do so, it not only affects the direct victims themselves but risks undermining wider public trust in our justice system. the most significant reform in this regard was arguably the introduction of the victims code by the last labour government, which came into force in 2006. the victims code sets out the rights and entitlements of victims, making it the single most important document for victims of crime in england and wales. it outlines clearly and precisely the level of entitlement that victims can expect from each criminal justice agency they encounter, including the police, the crown prosecution service and her majesty ' s courts and tribunals service. for example, the code specifies that victims are entitled to be kept informed of developments in their case within set time limits, and that victims must be informed of any sentence handed down to the offender and what it means. victim support has found evidence to suggest that there is a routine failure to uphold the victims code. the lack of compliance could be due to the victims code not being legally enforceable, or the absence of a mechanism to hold agencies to account except in individual cases, or the lack of an independent body to monitor implementation. current monitoring arrangements rely on statutory agencies self - assessing their compliance, based on criteria determined by the agencies themselves. effectively, these agencies are self - regulating. there are new setbacks for victims of crime on the horizon, with the announcement that the government plan to sell off more than 100 courts for not much more than the average uk house price."", ""with permission, mr speaker, i should like to make a statement. today, the secretary of state for justice and i are launching the government ' s victims strategy, which sets out our vision for victims of crime in england and wales. that vision is of a justice system that supports even more victims to speak up with the certainty that they will be understood, protected and supported, whether or not they report a crime and regardless of their circumstances or background. however, no single department, agency or emergency service alone can provide the services that victims rightly expect to receive, as shown by recent major incidents and tragedies such as the grenfell tower fire and terrorist attacks in london and manchester. to truly deliver on our vision, we must all work together. that is why we have today published, for the first time, a cross - government victims strategy, further delivering on this government ' s commitment to ensure that victims of crime get the support they need. this strategy is the latest milestone in improving that support for victims and builds on important progress over the past few years under governments of both parties, such as the establishment of the first code of practice for victims in 2006 ; the appointment of the first victims ' commissioner to champion the interests of victims and witnesses in 2010 ; and the publication of a€œgetting it right for victims and witnessesa€ in 2012, which set out the government ' s approach to ensuring that victims and witnesses get the support they need. the victims strategy consolidates and builds on that progress but recognises that more still needs to be done. i thank and pay tribute to all the victims, victims ' groups and experts who have willingly shared their experiences and sat on the victims panel, and to my predecessor, my hon. friend the member for bracknell ( dr lee ), who initiated this work.""]"

the latest figures show that services for deaf children are reducing across england. that means that their futures are being a€œstolena€, as the national deaf children ' s society puts it, because without the support, intervention and specialist skills that they need, they will not be able to make the best educational and social progress compared with other children who are not deaf or hearing impaired. that cannot be right. there are more than 50, 000 deaf children and young people in the uk. as we have heard, more than 90 % of them are born to hearing parents who have no prior experience of deafness. some 80 % of those children attend mainstream schools, where they may be the only deaf child in their school. figures from the national deaf children ' s society show a stark difference in educational achievement as it is. in the early years foundation stage, 34 % of pre - school deaf children were reported as having a good level of development compared with 76 % of other children. at key stage 2, less than half of deaf children achieved the expected standard for reading, compared with 80 % of other children. at key stage 4, deaf children achieve, on average, a whole grade less in each gcse subject than other children. in recent years this attainment gap has widened."", ""i agree strongly with my hon. friend ' s point. it is really important that deaf children are able to take part fully in the life of the school. in 2016 - 17, signature carried out a survey of more than 2, 000 young people, of whom 700 were deaf and 1, 400 were hearing, on behalf of the national deaf children ' s society youth advisory board, which is made up of young people from across the uk, such as erin, who believe strongly that there should be more opportunities for young people - deaf or hearing - to learn bsl, which is an officially recognised language in the uk. the survey showed that 91 % of young people want to learn sign language, 92 % think schools should offer a bsl gcse, and 97 % think bsl should be taught in schools. their reasons include inclusivity, as doing those things would ensure that deaf people are fully integrated into society and not disadvantaged because others cannot communicate with them effectively ;

long may it remain so. another point worthy of note is that the new management of channel 4 have embraced the process. a year ago, when i was re - elected to the house of commons and had my first contacts with channel 4, there were doubts about whether it could possibly come out of london and whether the talent would be available, and we heard about moving schools and all the same sorts of excuses that were made in the debate about the bbc 10 or 15 years ago. i am very pleased. i congratulate ministers and shadow ministers on keeping up the pressure ; i think channel 4 management are now behind the process. channel 4 is a great british institution. there are few that are similar in other nations in europe, except perhaps zdf and ard in germany. to have two great public service broadcasters, and channel 4 with its particular remit, is something that makes me proud to be british.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the relocation of channel 4. it is a pleasure to see you in the chair, sir graham. channel 4 is undoubtedly one of our finest, most precious broadcasting assets, as evidenced by the fact that there has been intense interest from many cities and regions across the united kingdom in hosting its new national headquarters and new creative hubs, representing 300 new channel 4 jobs, which will not only expand its footprint across the united kingdom but deepen its relationship with viewers. rightly, channel 4 has set a high bar for bidding cities and regions, requiring robust local infrastructure and transport and, in particular, frequent, fast and reliable connectivity. for the national headquarters, it is looking for a home with a population of at least 200, 000, travel time to the city of london within three hours and a high level of physical and digital connectivity. as a glasgow member of parliament, i am sure right hon. and hon. members will understand that i am immensely pleased to see that my home city is putting in a bold, strong and ambitious bid to be the new home of channel 4. i am particularly pleased that the chair of that bid is the famous glaswegian journalist and broadcaster stuart cosgrove. beyond channel 4 ' s physical requirements, it is ultimately looking for somewhere it can feel at home. it is looking for a diverse city that has a thriving arts and production scene ; a city that is not afraid to go against the grain ; and a city that has a confident sense of itself but is always looking to stretch itself and take on new challenges. setting aside the physical criteria, i wish to set out the case for scotland ' s largest city. the truth is that if channel 4 was a city, it would be the city of glasgow."", 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir graham. i congratulate the hon. member for glasgow south ( stewart malcolm mcdonald ) on securing this backbench debate. when launching a€œ4 all the uka€, the chief executive of channel 4, alex mahon, said : a€œas a public service broadcaster with diversity in its dna, channel 4 has a unique ability to reflect our society. this is a significant and exciting moment of change for channel 4 as we evolve to ensure we are best suited to serve all of the uk. with this new strategy we will go even further to make sure that people right across the uk are represented on screen and in the make up of our own organisation - and it will also build on what we already do to support creative businesses, jobs and economies in the nations and regions. a€today we have an opportunity to debate what that means and how channel 4 can achieve that objective in practice with three new creative hubs and a new national headquarters outside london. as we have already heard, the criteria that channel 4 has set for its new national headquarters is that the new location should have a working population of at least 200, 000, travel time to london of up to three hours, and a high level of physical and digital connectivity and infrastructure. in addition, channel 4 has listed five considerations that it has identified to support the evaluation of submissions that will be undertaken by channel 4 and its advisers. the considerations are economic, demographic, diversity and environmental factors ; the existing availability of talent and a future pipeline, including educational links ; local connectivity and broader infrastructure ; ease and speed of travel for channel 4 employees and partners between the different creative hubs ; and effectiveness and efficiency of available office space. i want to argue today that the west midlands should be the choice for channel 4 to meet those criteria.']"

we are not copying and pasting other agreements. we are seeking a particular bespoke agreement relevant to the uk ' s economy. the model i have been discussing does not strike the right balance on democratic control and mutual market access that we want in our future partnership with the eu. secondly, our ambition as a global trading nation goes beyond the scope of efta ' s existing free trade agreements with third countries. efta ' s ftas are not suited to the size and type of the economy in britain. they are not with the larger economies of the world - countries and economies with whom we would wish to be pursuing new economic partnerships.""]"

teenage mothers are nearly four times as likely to smoke before or during pregnancy than those aged 35 and over. young mothers are less likely to quit before or during pregnancy, and only 38 % of mothers under the age of 20 did so, compared with 58 % of mothers aged 35 or above. it is clear that the government need to tackle smoking in pregnancy, and smoking in childhood, as a matter of urgency to achieve their ambition of a smoke - free generation. the minister and his department have a huge challenge on their hands if they are to meet the ambitious targets set out in the tobacco control plan. i still welcome the plan as the right thing to do, as i am sure the minister does. anything that is worth doing is going to be hard. we have four years to go before the target date, and the minister must now look at how the government can properly fund smoking cessation services to drive down smoking rates and support those who need extra help to stop smoking. i look forward to the remainder of the debate and the minister ' s closing remarks."", ""i beg to move, that leave be given to bring in a bill to require the secretary of state to report on means of requiring tobacco companies to meet the costs of smoking cessation services ; to make provision about the advertising and marketing of products that are alternatives to tobacco ; to require tobacco companies to publish information about their activities in relation to such products ; to create an offence of selling tobacco without a licence ; and for connected purposes. in 1990, almost one third of adults in great britain smoked. the most recent figures show that this has almost halved - the prevalence rate is now 15. 8 %. the government ' s ambition, set out in the tobacco control plan last year, is to reach 12 % or less by 2022, with a longer - term aim of achieving a 5 % prevalence rate. despite that relative success, the uk still has 7. 6 million smokers, which means that more than 200 people a day still die from smoking - related illnesses that could have been prevented, and that smoking is estimated to cost our economy in excess of a£11 billion a year. in 2017, local authorities cut their budgets for stop smoking services in half. separately, the number of smokers using nhs stop smoking services has decreased from a peak of 100, 000 in 2011 to 40, 000 in 2016. the bill aims to highlight what a package of measures could do to accelerate the decline in smoking prevalence. at the heart of this new approach is the creation of a new fund that would be used primarily to supplement local authorities ' cessation expenditure, while simultaneously encouraging cigarette companies to shift away from combustible products to less harmful alternatives. i know many are very wary of those products and the fact that many are produced or funded by tobacco companies. we must recognise that the tobacco companies have been extremely dishonest in the past about the harm caused by smoking."", ""it is a pleasure to take part in today ' s debate, and i welcome the one - year anniversary of the tobacco control policy for england. a great deal of progress has been made in reducing smoking prevalence across the uk. as has been pointed out, whereas in 1974 more than half of adult males and more than two in five women smoked, the latest figures from nhs digital suggest that smoking rates in the uk are now 15. 1 %. so i say congratulations on that achievement. the figures on smoking prevalence in scotland, where i come from, vary as between sources, but the office for national statistics has suggested a prevalence rate of 16. 3 % in 2017. since 2010, scotland has seen the largest decline in the proportion of smokers of the four uk jurisdictions, with a reduction of more than eight percentage points. that said, there are still about 10, 000 smoking - related deaths per year and 128, 000 smoking - related hospital admissions in scotland. the scottish government published their new five - year tobacco control plan in june. it goes a little further than the tobacco control plan for england, in that it not only puts forward a vision of a smoke - free generation but sets a date, 2034, by which we wish to achieve that vision. if scotland is to achieve its vision, it requires action by the westminster government on issues that are not devolved, such as tax, illicit trade and smoking in the entertainment media. page 14 of the tobacco control plan for scotland commits the scottish government toa€œcontinue to work with the uk government to address the representation of tobacco use in the media. a€that is not something that the scottish government can do on their own. a clear causal link has been established between exposure to smoking on screen in the entertainment media and smoking initiation in young people.""]"

what about the huge number of existing meters that will be removed and need to be disposed of as smart meters are installed? those meters are not owned by installers but by meter asset providers that finance and ultimately own the meters that are put in. it has been a long - standing arrangement in the industry that meters are not owned by the suppliers but merely read by the suppliers. that means that when a programme is pursued of removing old meters, whether dumb meters or previous generation smart meters, there is a problem in identifying whose meters they are. the difficulty that we are facing right now - it is not a problem for the future - is that we might see meter mountains arising in this country because the people who are removing the meters do not know who their owners are or who is going to take them away and recycle and dispose of them. i do not want to see, as a result of this roll - out programme, meter mountains, or alps, appearing across the country.']"

it covers door - to - door transport, ranging from the relatively informal lift giving by volunteer car drivers to more organised schemes such as a dial - a - ride or dial - a - bus for people with disabilities and mobility difficulties. it involves community bus services and covers minibus travel for groups of people such as the elderly or others who struggle to get out and about on their own, where they are taken on shopping trips and such like."", 'that is a really important point ; i thank the hon. gentleman for that intervention. the problem is that, as a consequence of the regulations, people will be denied access to local amenities, leisure facilities and employment opportunities. my hon. friend the member for nottingham south indicated the cost - some a£400 million. people are rightly angry and frustrated about the implications of the changes. i am angry about the quality of the transport infrastructure in my constituency, and this will simply compound that. the proposed guidance from the government implies that community transport providers need to show that they are not blocking commercial operators that may wish to deliver a local service on a particular route - the section 19 and 22 recommendations that have been mentioned. however, community transport is plugging the gaps of a failing commercial network. the ongoing withdrawal of commercial bus services means that the community transport sector as a whole has gained growing importance in filling transport gaps, particularly in largely rural areas such as mine. many voluntary transport services are financially fragile, and rely on donations and the goodwill of volunteers to continue. the government must realise that community transport is about so much more than simply moving people from a to b. it brings people together, teaches people new skills, makes disabled and elderly people in rural areas less socially isolated, improves physical and mental health, and makes communities pull together to tackle many issues that they face on a daily basis. i share the reservations of community transport providers in my constituency that the department for transport, sitting in splendid isolation in offices in central london, may find it difficult to comprehend the service and support provided by community transport. i share the view of my hon. friend the member for nottingham south that the narrow and legalistic approach that the government are adopting to community transport is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.', ""i, like a number of colleagues, will focus on community transport. as a labour and co - operative mp, i am particularly keen to talk about the not - for - profit sector. the co - operative party believes that community transport and commercial bus routes should be designated community assets that are, as my hon. friend the member for harrow west ( gareth thomas ) said, subject to the same protections as community assets are afforded under the localism act 2011. tens of thousands of people rely on these services for some of the most socially necessary journeys. the government ' s announcement that they seek to change regulations on the community transport sector was a big surprise. as a result, many such services are now under threat, and there will be a reduction in this socially necessary public transport. community transport is a very broad term. it includes local road passenger transport services delivered by charities and other not - for - profit organisations, typically where there is no viable commercial market. the core of community transport organisations includes door - to - door transport, informal lift - giving by volunteer car drivers, dial - a - ride and dial - a - bus, particularly for people with disabilities and mobility difficulties, and groups such as the elderly and others who struggle to get out and about. this transport is required, for example, to take them on shopping trips. the community transport association estimates that tens of thousands of people, many of whom are the most vulnerable in our communities, access this form of transport. it has outlined why these journeys are such a lifeline for many. preston community transport, which is based in my constituency, is just one such community transport organisation. it claims that there are nowa€œsignificant problems as a result of the department for transport ' s proposed changes to permits and licences.""]"

only trade has received nearly 93, 000 signatures. this issue has been the subject of a long - standing campaign by animal welfare organisations, but as most people who have followed the issue know, and as my hon. friend acknowledged, european union free trade rules have prevented the government from taking meaningful action on this over the past 30 years. however, once we leave the european union, we will be able to take action on what for many people is an iconic animal welfare issue. while eu trade rules might have prevented governments from banning the live export trade, we have still seen a dramatic change in the numbers of live animals exported, particularly those destined for slaughter. some 25 years ago, around 2 million animals were exported each and every year. the peak of live exports going from the uk for slaughter was in 1992, when a total of around 400, 000 cattle, 300, 000 pigs and nearly 1. 5 million sheep were exported from the uk directly for slaughter. as a result of the high number of animals being exported, live export became extremely controversial, with widespread demonstrations against it at the main ports during the 1990s. port authorities and shipping companies were put under considerable pressure to end the trade, which led to nearly all the main ferry operators refusing to take animals destined for slaughter.', 'i am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, mr wilson, and to take part in a debate on such an important issue. the export of live farm animals can cause great suffering in many cases, as was outlined by a number of right hon. and hon. members, particularly my hon. friends the members for st austell and newquay ( steve double ) and for southend west ( sir david amess ), and the hon. member for bristol east ( kerry mccarthy ). last year i proposed a ten - minute rule bill to implement a ban on the export of live animals for slaughter or for fattening, because i believe it to be unethical to export animals to countries where they can be subjected to treatment that would be unlawful in the united kingdom. i am concerned, as are many others who have spoken this afternoon, that the rules regulating the transport and slaughter of animals that are supposed to apply across every eu member state are not always effectively enforced in every part of the european union once animals leave this country. many of the sheep exported from the uk are sent to france, but there is clear evidence of inhumane and illegal slaughter practices in a number of places there - a problem acknowledged in a 2016 report by a committee of inquiry in the french parliament. in my view, that of the people who signed the petition, and that of many of my constituents, it is not acceptable for the uk to send animals to die in such horrendous conditions. we have had extensive discussion about calves that are exported from scotland to spain, and are subjected to a 20 - hour sea journey to northern france, and then a drive all the way to spain. the total journey time can be as much as 135 hours.', 'i congratulate my hon. friend the member for st austell and newquay ( steve double ) on introducing the debate. i want to touch on a number of issues very briefly, and to deal with a couple of the points raised by my hon. friend the member for north herefordshire ( bill wiggin ). i normally agree with him, but on this occasion there is clearly a little difference between us. let us tackle the fundamental difference between live animals for slaughter, live animals for fattening and live animals for breeding stock. we all understand what a€œlive animals for slaughtera€ means - that is what the petition is about. my understanding is that a€œlive animals for fatteninga€ is a euphemism for exporting livestock from the united kingdom to france, spain, italy or greece, where they spend a couple of days in a field and are then slaughtered and branded as local meat, be that french, spanish, greek or italian. effectively, those animals are live animals for slaughter. my view is that any control exercise should embrace those animals, as well as those that are openly and honestly - if that is the right word - exported for slaughter. breeding stock is different. rather like the racehorses that were referred to earlier, they are high - value animals, they are well looked after and they are transported with great care. that is not the case with animals that are exported for other purposes. the standards in the united kingdom may occasionally be not too bad, but the standards in mainland europe are unenforced and unenforceable. in theory they are supposed to be high, but in practice, as we all know, they are not.']"

i never entered politics with the intention of becoming a baby loss awareness campaigner. as with so many in this field, the loss of a child - my son in 2014 - brought about my interest and desire to bring about change. and being a member of this house, gives every one of us the platform to make a difference. it can be a small change that affects just one of our constituents, or it can be something larger that affects everyone in the uk. i am proud that through my role in this house i have been able to play even just a small part in the development and roll - out of the national bereavement care pathway, which is something that will make a difference to tens of thousands of bereaved parents and families up and down the country. before i move on to the pathway itself, i want to pay tribute to you, mr speaker. you have been hugely supportive of our baby loss awareness campaigning efforts in this place, and i know i speak for all members of the all - party group on baby loss when i say a heart - felt thank you. launched last year at 11 sites across england, the pathway has been developed by a number of baby loss charities, royal colleges and professional organisations with the support of the department of health and social care and the appg. it is designed to improve the quality of bereavement care experienced by parents and families at all stages of pregnancy and baby loss up to 12 months. the pathway provides a practical framework for all those healthcare and other professionals involved and has been informed and led by the views of bereaved parents at every stage of its development.']"

the use of the private sector has been progressed by successive governments over many years. the present government blame labour for introducing private finance initiatives, which they say have burdened the nhs with eye - watering debts, but the government compounded the problem through pf2. they also blame labour for opening up the nhs to marketisation by splitting primary care trusts into commissioning and provider arms, and introducing the concept of a€œany preferred providera€ in its transforming community services programme, even though the secretary of state at the time, andy burnham, expressly stated that the nhs would always be the preferred provider of services. yet from 2010 onwards this government extended that model, creating clinical commissioning groups and pursuing competition and commercialisation with renewed vigour. today, therefore, many traditional public health services are run by private providers such as virgin care and gp consortiums in their own right - services such as out - of - hours urgent care, sexual health and mental health residential care. the health and social care act 2012 was designed to bring in a far greater private sector element to the nhs through expansion of the internal market. since then, the privatisation picture has been more mixed than had been feared, not only as a result of campaigns by unison, the gmb and others, but because various government initiatives to boost privatisation fell flat. however, there is still significant evidence of increasing privatisation, with companies such as virgin, serco and spire continuing to prosper.', ""that supports my point, and is a great example. the government view of outsourcing does not reflect the reality of privatisation. did patients receive the best quality of care from the private firm circle when it took over management of hinchingbrooke hospital in 2012, making it the first privately run nhs hospital, only to withdraw from its contract two years later after it was placed in special measures by the care quality commission because it had found serious failings in its emergency and medical care services? what about the 2013 public accounts committee report into serco ' s running of gp out - of - hours care in cornwall, which accused the private company of bullying employees, providing a short - staffed and substandard service, and manipulating data to hide the truth? were patients receiving the best quality of care then? what about the imposition of financial penalties on the same company by nhs commissioners in suffolk in 2014, after it missed key targets in its community health services contract? in 2012 harmoni, a private provider of nhs out - of - hours gp services, having put in place an aggressive cost - cutting agenda, faced allegations from senior doctors that its service in london was so short - staffed that its patients were unsafe. i could recount many more examples of failed healthcare privatisation, but we do not have time. the government also claim that outsourcing allows the nhs to save money, but that is not necessarily true. the process by which private companies bid for contracts allows them effectively to cherry - pick the most profitable forms of treatment - usually low - risk elective surgeries. that allows the private sector to benefit from the predictable, and usually low, cost. that is far from providing the best quality of care for patients. why, then, do the government insist on continued nhs privatisation?"", ""i, too, want to use this opportunity to debunk the myth that the conservative party wants to, or ever has wanted to, privatise the nhs. that is an image that the labour party wants to portray, but the facts tell a different story. in the 70 years of the nhs, 43 of those years have been under a conservative government, so if privatising the nhs were the sole aim of the conservative party, it would have been done by now. the nhs remains based on the three founding principles of meeting the needs of everyone, being free at the point of use, and being based on clinical need, not ability to pay. however, facts do not often matter to the labour party. i was at a meeting at the weekend of more than 200 gps who were desperate for the politics to be taken out of the nhs. they welcome the government ' s talk of a long - term settlement and of taking the nhs out of the political cycle. that puts fear into the heart of labour because it would mean that the nhs would come first, not the motives of the labour party. if labour members were honest with themselves, they would recall the history of the last labour government, who did more for privatisation in the nhs than anyone before or since. in 1999, within two years of coming to power, the labour government set up market structures in the nhs to create choice and competition, with hospitals starting to charge by price per episode to compete with the private sector. that is labour ' s record on privatisation in the nhs. in 2003, they set up foundation trusts so that hospitals could be free from the constraints of the nhs and run like a business. that is labour ' s record of privatisation in the nhs. also in 2003, they introduced independent sector treatment centres - private companies set up to provide wholly nhs elective procedures.""]"

they have been re - brokered very successfully to others. the essence of the free schools and academies programme is that we do not allow schools to languish in special measures year after year, which in essence is what was happening when those schools were under local authority control. we take very swift action where schools underperform, and we will not change the law that requires schools to become academies once they go into special measures, because that is how we get improvement. i will come on to some of the examples of how that works in due course. every child in this country, regardless of where they live or their background, should have the opportunity to benefit from the very best education. free schools and academies have shown that professional autonomy in the hands of able headteachers and teachers can deliver a world - class education. for example, dixons trinity academy, a free school in bradford, achieved extraordinary results in 2017. its first set of gcses placed it among the top schools in england for the progress achieved by its pupils. strikingly, the progress score for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds was higher than that for the whole school, including more affluent peers. that school and many others show that socioeconomic background should not and need not be a barrier to academic success. leading multi - academy trusts, often led by inspirational headteachers, demonstrate that excellence need not be restricted to isolated schools. thanks to a forensic approach to curriculum design and the implementation of evidence - based approaches to managing behaviour, the inspiration trust in norfolk and the harris federation in london - two of the best performing multi - academy trusts - have conclusively demonstrated that all pupils can achieve whether they live in coastal norfolk or inner - city london.', ""as i have said, in 2016, cambridgeshire county council issued the school with a warning notice. to ensure sustainability of standards the interim executive board was established. the board is consulting on the next steps, and it has made the decision that it is best for the school to become an academy under the diocese. it is consulting on that decision, and it is taking parents ' views into account. it had a meeting today, as the hon. gentleman said, and it will continue to go through the process. overall in cambridgeshire, 97 % of secondary schools are academies or free schools, and we expect that to be 100 % shortly. one third of primary schools are currently academies or free schools, and that number is expected to rise in the coming year, with 17 schools currently moving to academy status. in the hon. gentleman ' s constituency, there are six secondary schools. five of them are academies, and the remaining school intends to become an academy this term. there are 23 primary schools and a maintained special school. just two of the primary schools are academies or free schools, and four primary schools are currently going through the process of joining a multi - academy trust, which is significantly lower than elsewhere in cambridgeshire. in september 2014, 82 % of primary schools in cambridge were rated good or outstanding by ofsted. in november last year, that rose to 91 %, which is above the national average. four of the five secondary academies have positive progress 8 scores, including chesterton community college, part of cambridgeshire educational trust, which is in the top 1 % of schools nationally and was recently graded by ofsted as outstanding. cambridgeshire educational trust is a great example of the development of the school - led system in which teaching approaches have raised academic results.""]"

it can be an invisible disability that is not recognised. this evening i will talk about the issues facing children with acquired brain injury, particularly in education, which was one of the topics on which the appg heard evidence. department of health data shows that in a four - year period, 39, 000 under five were admitted to hospital because of falls. many of these children will be discharged as fully recovered, although the outcome of traumatic brain injuries in children may not become clear until their brain is fully matured. in fact, despite the early years being a key point in brain development, it is also the time when children are most vulnerable to injury. sadly, it is also the least supported age group. the appg heard from the child brain injury trust in one of our meetings that children are very different from adults after acquired brain injury, because their brains are still developing and will continue to do so until they are in their mid - 20s.']"

to require banks to enable free cash withdrawals from current accounts in other circumstances ; to require the financial conduct authority to supervise an access to banking standard ; to impose penalties for breaches of that standard ; to establish a financial inclusion fund, and provide for amounts received in such penalties to be paid into that fund ; and for connected purposes. recently link, which set the funding formula for atm operators, consulted its members on proposals to reduce from 25p to 20p the interchange fee paid to atm operators by banks when cash is withdrawn. the first phase of the cut will take place on 1 july 2018. this proposed reduction in the funding formula has led to concerns that many atms will become financially unviable and therefore may be forced to close or charge a fee to remain in use. the bill seeks to remove the option for atms to become fee - charging by banning fees. i take this position, first and foremost, out of principle, as i do not believe that anyone should have to pay to access their own money. however, a ban on atm charges makes it a practical necessity that an appropriate funding formula for free - to - use atms be devised. in supporting this objective, the bill seeks to provide a legal requirement for access to cash withdrawals through atms or other means where there is a demand for it. such demand would be established through a full market review of the atm network by the payment systems regulator. there has been no recent review of the demand for access to cash, and as we transition towards a cashless society it is important that we fully and comprehensively establish where demand remains for cash in order to target resources effectively.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the effect of atm closures on towns, high streets and rural communities. it is a pleasure to see you in the chair, mr hollobone. i and other hon. members on both sides of the house have been raising the closure of atms and its impact on our towns, high streets and rural communities for some time. the issue is more pressing than ever. in november 2017, link, the atm membership body that sets the funding for free - to - use atms, began consulting on proposed cuts to the funding mechanism known as the interchange rate fee - a fee paid to the atm operator, by the bank or company that issues a consumer ' s bank card, when cash is withdrawn. prior to link ' s reductions, that fee was 25p. in its consultation, link proposed reducing the fee to 20p through four rounds of cuts beginning on 1 july this year and ending in january 2021, although the third cut was cancelled and the fourth has been put under review. from the beginning, link accepted that those changes would lead to atm closures. in its analysis and consultation documents, it stated that it expected a decline of between 1 % and 11 % in free - to - use atms, but that it was confident that there would be a reduction only in areas with a high concentration of free - to - use atms, such as cities. however, the number of closures has been far higher - approximately 250 per month - since link announced its consultation. operators such as note machine and cardtronics say they expect to lose thousands of machines each, and new installations have been put on hold.""]"

the question is the extent to which they can be tailored or lifted to suit appropriate local circumstances. first, however, let me say something about accessibility issues. our london taxis have a fantastic record : all 21, 000 are wheelchair - accessible, but the story is not the same across the country. i am told that in metropolitan areas outside london, 83 % of taxis are wheelchair - accessible, but in some rural areas the figure falls as low as 15 %. one of the challenges that we face is making our taxi and private hire fleet more accessible to people throughout the country. there is a lot of variation in the approach to disability awareness training, which only 41 % of local authorities require for taxi drivers and only 38 % require for private hire vehicle drivers. over the past few years, the percentage of local authorities that require taxi and private hire vehicle drivers to complete training on the subject of child sexual abuse or exploitation has risen to 70 %, partly in response to some very sad incidents in some parts of the country. however, that leaves nearly 100 licensing authorities that still do not require drivers to undertake such training. i became interested in the subject when i had the privilege of serving as a shadow transport minister for a couple of years. when i later had the opportunity to introduce a private member ' s bill, i chose to try to do something about safety issues, on which there is cross - party consensus. since i introduced my bill - the licensing of taxis and private hire vehicles ( safeguarding and road safety ) bill - some 18 months ago, i have had the opportunity to discuss the issue with enforcement officers and officials from knowsley to london and with taxi and private hire firms from brighton to manchester.""]"

they are big countries with very strong regulatory regimes in which this practice has been carried out. therefore, there have been multiple opportunities to have all the scientific evidence evaluated and to have all the upsides and downsides considered. it is very clear that the upsides are so massive that they require this country to follow suit. it is a shame that we are not yet in a position in this country to have mandatory fortification of flour. it has been 27 years since the medical research council published its research demonstrating that supplementing women ' s diets with folic acid before the early stages of pregnancy reduced the chances of the pregnancy being affected by neural tube defects. that was in 1991. it was in 1990 that my son, andrew, was born with spina bifida. very soon after he was born, we became experts in the whole area of spina bifida : the reasons for it, how it develops and all the rest of it."", ""i congratulate my hon. friend the member for pontypridd ( owen smith ) on securing this important debate and, as always, making an excellent case in favour of the fortification of flour and the science behind it. i also thank him and the right hon. member for belfast north ( nigel dodds ) for organising the recent event in parliament with the charity shine, among others. shine has worked for many years alongside my constituents, the walbyoffs, on whose behalf i speak. i will use my short contribution to give a voice to paul and liz, whose eldest daughter, sara, lives with spina bifida. my hon. friend for pontypridd explained comprehensively how the conditions caused by a low level of folic acid during a mother ' s pregnancy cause neural tube defects in an unborn child. sara was diagnosed with the condition weeks before the birth of the family ' s second child, alis. paul and liz tell me that, had they known that earlier, liz would have increased her dosage of folic acid during her pregnancy. indeed, mums such as liz would have benefited from the extra folic acid boost that would have come from the fortification of flour. the evidence suggests that, in as many as three out of four cases, that could be the difference between a baby being born with a neural tube defect and not. like many families across the country with a personal connection to the debate, paul and liz cannot understand why the uk has not introduced mandatory fortification of flour. other food products, such as cereal, are fortified with folic acid ; the rationale for excluding flour from fortification is unclear. there is clearly strong support for that among members of the medical profession.""]"

a very short time, as it turns out - exactly what we have done. the chief electoral officer for northern ireland is the returning officer and has responsibility for electoral registration, compiling the electoral roll and managing all elections in northern ireland. by and large, that has worked pretty well. before the electoral fraud ( northern ireland ) act 2002, the head of household was required to register all residents who were eligible to vote. the 2002 act changed the registration procedure, introducing individual electoral registration and requiring eligible voters to provide the office of the chief electoral officer for northern ireland with their signature, date of birth, national insurance number and current residence. the act also required voters to present photographic identity. many people in northern ireland therefore acquired an id card, first, for purposes of electoral identification and, secondly, because when travelling from northern ireland to the mainland, photographic evidence has to be provided. the id card was a method of doing so. people could get an id card for the price of two photographs, whereas applying for a passport cost a£68, or a£40 for an irish passport. that was how it was done, so people saved money. over the years, we have encouraged our constituents to apply for id cards, and many have done just that. id cards were introduced to counter a lack of public confidence in the electoral process in northern ireland. by and large, the act changed that. there are still some issues with proxy and postal votes, but those can be looked at and changes made. a voter id card scheme is one that i would support fully. i will give a quick example of where frustrations can arise.', ""i want to make some progress. i have big concerns about the potential disenfranchisement of voters in areas where people who are legally entitled to vote may not have identification in line with the requirements. even before discussing the concept of voter id, the requirements across the pilot schemes were wide ranging and different, meaning that aggregated findings or comparative analysis will both be questionable in any government evaluation. bromley, gosport and woking required id documents, whereas swindon and watford required only a poll card. interestingly, none of the trial areas had a significantly poorer or more ethnically diverse population than the national average, or any recent historical examples of voter fraud or voter impersonation. as i said, bromley council ' s impact assessment stated that there would be a noticeable effect on the elderly and trans people. it highlighted concerns that voters in those categories would be less likely to have up - to - date documentation in line with the requirements. as my hon. friend the member for slough ( mr dhesi ) said, prior to the roll - out the equality and human rights commission warned the government that voter id schemes would have a disproportionate impact on voters with protected characteristics, particularly those from ethnic minority communities, older people, trans people and people with disabilities. before committing to any further changes to the way in which citizens vote, we should look at the experience of other countries that have rolled out identification checks at elections. experience from the united states has shown that voter id schemes disproportionately affected marginalised groups, because those who could not afford to drive or go on holiday often did not have the specified documentation. figures from the last census, recorded in 2011, show that 9 million people in the uk do not hold a driving licence and 9. 5 million do not hold a passport."", 'i would make two points in response to that. first, one should not necessarily accept that all those who were refused the right to vote were genuine voters. everyone received several reminders about voter id and had the opportunity, if without the right id, to get a local elector card. it is important to note that people must come to the polling station with the correct id, as they do in northern ireland. woking went out of its way to publicise that. this was effectively the first time ever that people were asked to present voter id at the polling station, and personally i think that the number of refusals was remarkably small. for a pilot area, a one - off, i do not think that anyone would expect anything else. furthermore, as i have said already, the turnout increased by comparison with the most equivalent elections. if we extrapolate from that, that is hundreds of thousands of voters across the nation in a general election.']"

we will retain the bonds of friendship, security and trade that have united britain and europe for so long. if we want to achieve that, before we leave the european union we must put in place the essential legal powers and structures that will enable the uk to operate an independent trade policy. that is what our trade legislation is designed to achieve. in this, as in all our legislation, the department for international trade will be guided by what delivers the greatest economic advantage to the uk and ensures the continued confidence of our partners and allies. the bill contains six delegated powers allowing the government to make regulations to support and develop their trade policy. two of the powers allow the government to amend primary legislation ; they relate to ensuring the continuity of eu trade agreements into a uk - only context and to the collection of exporter information by her majesty ' s revenue and customs. both powers are subject to significant restrictions on how they can be used. the trade agreement continuity powers are limited in scope ; in particular, they can be used to amend primary legislation only when it forms part of retained eu law. we intend to use the powers to make necessary amendments to domestic legislation as part of the transition project. by taking those powers, we can be sure that we have the ability to implement efficiently all obligations of existing trade agreements in our new context. the eu ' s trade agreements, which we intend to transition and which are within the scope of this bill, will have already been scrutinised by parliament ' s eu committees. free trade agreements that the uk has already ratified have also been through the normal parliamentary scrutiny process."", ""indeed, i do rise to speak to new clause 3, which is in my name and signed by more than 50 members of the house from four different parties, and i give notice that i would like to move it when it comes to the votes. this amendment essentially seeks to remedy the bill ' s failure to provide for a proper role for parliamentarians in the scrutiny and approval of trade agreements. at present, trade agreements can be negotiated, or renegotiated as is likely to be the case with many of the existing eu trade deals covered by this bill, entirely under royal prerogative powers, essentially giving the government free rein to decide when and with whom to start negotiations, to set their own priorities and objectives, to conduct the negotiations in great secrecy, and to conclude the deal without any meaningful parliamentary scrutiny. that not only sidelines members of this house, but it prevents valuable input by civil society organisations and the wider public. this bill is supposed to help implement an independent trade policy following withdrawal from the eu, but it does nothing to put in place the kind of scrutiny and approval framework that should be required for an accountable trade policy in a modern democratic country. and this is the only legislative opportunity we are likely to have to put such a framework in place. in his statement yesterday, the secretary of state for international trade once again sought to make a distinction between replacements for existing eu trade deals and future trade deals, but the fact is that effective parliamentary scrutiny and approval is needed for both, for it is increasingly clear that, contrary to the hope of ministers, it is not going to be a simple case of transitioning, or a€œrolling over, a€ existing eu trade deals. some or all of the countries in question are not simply going to be content to continue with the existing arrangements, and ministers will have little choice but to negotiate a replacement deal."", ""i beg to move an amendment, to leave out from a€œthata€ to the end of the question and add : a€œthis house recognises that on leaving the european union, whether or not the uk concludes a new long - term customs union with the eu, it will need effective legislation to implement agreements with partner countries corresponding to international trade agreements of the european union in place before the uk ' s exit, to implement procurement obligations arising from the uk becoming a member of the government procurement agreement in its own right, to establish a trade remedies authority to deliver the new uk trade remedies framework, and to establish powers for her majesty ' s revenue and customs to collect and disclose data on exporters, but declines to give a second reading to the trade bill because it fails to set out proper procedures for parliamentary consultation, scrutiny, debate and approval of future international trade agreements, fails to protect the principle of parliamentary sovereignty in the implementation of those trade agreements previously negotiated by the european union and in respect of changes to existing government procurement regulations arising from the uk ' s or other countries ' accession to the government procurement agreement, fails to establish sufficient scrutiny procedures to replace those that have pertained while the uk has been a member of the european union, fails to guarantee that european union standards and rights will be protected in future trade agreements, and fails to render the trade remedies authority answerable to parliament or representative of the full range of stakeholders. a€may i take this opportunity to wish you, madam deputy speaker, and all those in this place who in their various ways serve the public, a very happy new year? our country is in the throes of an extraordinary change in our constitutional arrangements.""]"

overall, the co2 emissions of a diesel car tend to be lower, diesel fuel contains more energy per litre than petrol and diesel engines are more efficient than petrol engines, especially in rural environments. modern euro 6 diesel cars are the cleanest in history : they capture 99 % of particulates and emit 84 % fewer nox emissions than in 2000. so, we know that new diesels do not compare to the older ones. we also know from data from the society of motor manufacturers and traders that average co2 emissions from cars sold in 2017 were higher than in 2016, reversing a near 20 - year decline. they blame that increase on the demonisation of diesel since 2015, which means that we cannot take for granted the progress made in reducing co2 emissions since 2000. we are heading in the wrong direction, as diesel sales have fallen by 37 % since last year. mike hawes, smmt chief executive, criticised the autumn budget, which increased taxes on sales of new diesels. he commented that people were concerned about these tax increases and werea€œholding off buying new diesel cars because of the confusion and that means older, dirtier diesels are staying on the roads. a€that is precisely the point made by the hon. member for solihull ( julian knight ). nick molden, chief executive of testing company emissions analytics, agreed that, rather than impose higher taxes on new cars, the oldest cars and dirtiest diesel cars should be targeted instead.', ""that shows the cross - party agreement on some of the points i am making today. the trouble is that in the uk, germany, france and spain - the markets where anti - diesel rhetoric is highest - diesel consumption is declining fastest. sales of diesel cars have slumped as regulators and politicians announce plans for bans, levies and additional taxes in many cities. in truth, we in dagenham fear that diesel has become a bit of a political football. in 2001, gordon brown introduced a new system of car tax aimed at protecting the environment - a sliding scale to make it cheaper for cars with lower co2 emissions. that helped stimulate a dash for diesel after its introduction in 2001 and its extension in subsequent years. there are now some 12 million diesel cars on british roads, while back in 2000 there were only 3 million. in recent years, diesel has accounted for around half of the new car market. in 2000, by comparison, only one in seven new cars was a diesel model, yet following a 2017 bbc report on the dangers of diesel, the environment secretary jumped into the debate to make political capital : a€œthe dash for diesel was pursued under a labour government... this is yet another example of a conservative government having to clean up labour ' s mess... we are taking action... ending the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040. a€political game playing should have no role, given the challenges facing the sector, as reflected in the comments made by colleagues across the house today. since the 2015 vw revelations, cities have taken the lead over national governments."", ""as has been mentioned, this sector has been one of britain ' s greatest manufacturing success stories, providing thousands of jobs and a major contribution to our country ' s economic growth. the story of my own constituency ' s past cannot be told without an understanding of the sector, dominated by ford ' s dagenham plant, which at its height employed some 40, 000 workers. today, dagenham ' s two engine plants produce 1 million diesel engines annually - 50 % of ford ' s global diesel requirement - and provide over 3, 000 jobs. some 89 % of those engines are exported. the total turnover stands at a£1. 75 billion. however, investment in britain ' s car industry has halved during the past two years. brexit concerns and the demonization of diesel appear to be the two biggest challenges. the crisis of confidence in diesel vehicles and diesel technology was triggered by volkswagen ' s emissions scandal, but the upshot has been damage to not just vw but the whole sector. i am not seeking to defend older diesel engines, which, in truth, are more polluting than their petrol counterparts. however, we must bring some nuance back into the debate. all diesel technology is being tarred with the same brush, despite the fact that state - of - the - art diesel technology is a vast improvement over its predecessors. as has been mentioned, those dirtier engines will, ironically, be kept on the road longer if consumers are misinformed about the difference between diesel technologies. it is clean - diesel technology that is being invested in in dagenham. ford invested a£490 million in developing clean, cutting - edge diesel technology in dagenham in 2014. this new generation of clean engines meets the euro 6 emissions standards and satisfies transport for london ' s ultra - low emission zone.""]"

there is no equivalence and it is outrageous to suggest that there is. that is particularly the case given that some of the kids affected would face a hellish path to settlement, which the minister seems to be suggesting is a suitable alternative."", 'it is an honour to serve under your chairmanship, mr hollobone. i thank the hon. member for cumbernauld, kilsyth and kirkintilloch east ( stuart c. mcdonald ) for securing this debate and also the other members who have contributed. there appears to be a consensus that the amount charged is not acceptable. as of april this year, the cost of registering a child for citizenship was a£1, 012 - a 51 % increase since 2014. there are no exemptions, waivers, reductions or refunds for the fees, even though the secretary of state has the power to make provision for them. such outrageously high fees mean that children from poor and low - income families are prevented from accessing their right to citizenship. constantly increasing the price of an application makes it almost impossible to plan for future costs, and increases the chances of people losing status because they cannot afford the price. it is important to stress that the children would not be claiming anything. they are not paying for citizenship to be granted by the government, but for their existing entitlement to citizenship to be recognised. speaking to the home affairs select committee, the home secretary said the fee is, a€œa huge amount of money to ask children to pay for citizenshipa€. he said he woulda€œget around toa€looking at fees. my first question to the minister is : has anybody got around to looking at the issue yet? the aspect of fees that i personally have greatest difficulty with is the profit that the home office makes on the applications. of the a£1, 012 that is charged, a£372 is the cost of administration and almost two thirds is profit. the free movement website estimates that the home office has made nearly a£100 million in profits over the past five years.', 'if the hon. gentleman allows me to make some progress, i will turn to the points he made in his opening speech. during 2017 - 18, about 64, 000 people were granted indefinite leave to remain and 123, 000 were granted citizenship. of those granted citizenship, more than 28, 000 were minor children who were registered and were related to a british citizen, or children granted citizenship on a discretionary basis. in all cases the applicants either paid the due fee or had that fee paid on their behalf, reflecting the value placed on permanent residence and citizenship in the uk. the charging framework for visa and immigration services delivered a£1. 35 billion of income in the last financial year, 2017 - 18. that helped to fund more than a£620 million of costs associated with other immigration system functions, helping to maintain their effectiveness and security, and investment in ongoing service improvement. setting fees at above the cost of processing an application has also helped us to set some fees at below cost - for example, short - term visit visas, in recognition of the significant economic benefits that tourists and other visitors bring to the whole of the uk. the subsidy for the circa 2. 5 million short - term visit visas issued each year costs in the region of a£90 million per annum, which can be afforded only by setting a wide range of other fees. let me make one other obvious point : setting fees at the level that we do - putting the burden on those who benefit from the services - reduces the burden on the exchequer and on the general taxpayers of this country. it is easy, particularly in opposition, to call for fees or taxes to be reduced, but a responsible government must balance the books. the loss of income that would result from any reduction in fees would have to be made up elsewhere, and there have been rather fewer suggestions of how that might be achieved.']"

quality parks and green spaces now and for future generations. the government are committed to ensuring that our parks and open spaces continue to provide vibrant and inclusive places for local communities to enjoy. local parks are great at connecting communities and encouraging interaction between younger and older generations and between people from different backgrounds. i recognise that to achieve that shared goal we need to support local councils to deliver it, so it may be helpful if i set out what the government are doing to support the hon. lady ' s local area and, more broadly, if i touch on some of the activity the government are undertaking to safeguard parks and open spaces. on overall funding for local government, this government believe strongly that local people who know and understand their community are best placed to decide how funding should be spent in their area. that is why funding provided through the local government finance settlement is largely not ring - fenced, as it allows local authorities, which are independent of central government, to manage their budgets in line with local priorities. in practice, that means there is no specific funding stream for parks, just as there is not for waste services or children ' s services, for example. local communities are best placed to decide on their own local priorities."", ""even amidst the most built - up cities, we are blessed with parks and pockets of green space. those spaces improve air quality, lower temperatures near congested cities and even harbour wildlife, but they are also the lifeblood of our communities. as we face an obesity crisis and concerns over public health, parks offer free and accessible opportunities for exercise and enjoyment. at a time when families are living in ever more cramped conditions and unsuitable housing, parks provide a much - needed environment in which children without access to other opportunities can enjoy being children. in an era of extreme loneliness and isolation, they are bringing people of all ages together, and in an age of unprecedented privatisation and commercialisation of public space, they remain free for everyone to use and benefit from. according to the indices of multiple deprivation, my constituency is one of the most deprived in the country. government figures suggest that we might expect to see far fewer parks and open spaces in such areas than in wealthier areas. however, sheffield, brightside and hillsborough, despite its legacy as a highly urban formerly industrial area, is an exception to this, having substantial areas of parks and open space across the constituency. sheffield can lay claim to being the greenest city in europe, with a third of our city boundary lying within the peak district and a history of prestigious prizes won, including the 2005 entente florale gold medal. we are blessed with hundreds of parks and open spaces, and residents have access to a huge range of facilities, from small play parks to ancient woodlands. the national trust funded research in 2016 on sheffield ' s parks, which highlighted the huge value and benefit they hold for local people and the financial value that they represent to health and other public services."", 'i absolutely agree. that is the thrust of my speech tonight, and i have already detailed the effects of cuts to budgets for policing and public services. it would be easy to ask the minister to consider making parks statutory services, so that councils could be held to account more easily for their maintenance. however, my local parks would not be helped one bit by that without the government backing up the change with serious funding for local authorities to meet this requirement. labour and the conservatives have different views about local authority funding, and i do not think that we will resolve this difference tonight. as much as local authorities can innovate in developing and maintaining parks, it appears to be an unfortunate truth that there will always be higher costs. i ask the minister specifically to ensure that councils have enough capital funds to create parks that are resilient to the challenges they can face. i also ask him to work with the minister for sport to ensure that lottery funds specifically support parks facing difficulties with misuse and the lack of commercial income that i have outlined. as welcome as the a€œparks for peoplea€ programme was, its focus on heritage meant that parks in the most challenging areas sometimes lost out in favour of parks in traditionally leafier suburbs. i thank members and the minister for attending tonight. i also thank local people, interested organisations and local parks officers who all offered a wealth of information, so much of which i could not touch on tonight. i hope that i can make a small contribution to ensuring that we have resilient parks and green spaces in every part of my constituency and in every city. maintaining and improving parks for every citizen is an absolute necessity if we want to create a more equal, healthy and happy society.']"

hon. members who were here under the coalition government talked about having an elected house of lords, but they could not agree on one simple solution. the lords are talking about reform, and i will cover that point in a second. the hon. member for glasgow east ( david linden ) talked about hereditary peers. the daft thing is that, with the 92 who are left, it is a halfway house. i understand why people are concerned about the house of lords and either want to change it or question its legitimacy. in 2016, we had a ridiculous situation when there was a by - election for one of the members of the house of lords. a lib dem peer, lord avebury, died, and seven hereditary peers from around the country were put up for election, but the electorate was only three. how daft is it to have an electorate that is half the size of the field of candidates? it makes a mockery of the process, so we clearly need to look at the situation. the government have already gone some way towards trying to lay a path to change. the house of lords reform act 2014 allowed members, for the first time, to retire or resign permanently. those who do not attend or are convicted of a serious offence that carries a prison sentence of a year or more cease to be members. that was not the case before. again, it is a bit daft and i am glad it was sorted out. the house of lords ( expulsion and suspension ) act 2015 enabled a suspension running beyond the end of a parliament to be imposed on a member, and allowed the house of lords to expel members.']"

petition 200585 relating to childcare vouchers. i am pleased to serve under your chairmanship, mr bailey, and to lead this debate as a member of the petitions committee. i must also declare an interest as a beneficiary of the childcare vouchers scheme. the e - petition, entitled a€œkeep childcare vouchers open beyond april 2018a€, was signed by more than 116, 000 people, including almost 400 across my own city. it reads : a€œhundreds of thousands of parents will lose out under the new tax - free childcare. the voucher schemes should be kept open alongside tax - free childcare to give parents a genuine choice for the support that best suits their family. a€the creator of the e - petition, ellie symonds - lloyd, is in the gallery with her family. i am particularly pleased to be leading this debate, given the importance of the wider issue to our society and to the economy as a whole. increasing the availability of affordable childcare, particularly for younger children, is one of the key issues for many of britain ' s families, with a huge impact on their standard of living. as the joseph rowntree foundation highlighted after the publication of the 2017 childcare survey by the family and childcare trust last march : a€œthe biggest cost for many working households with children, after housing, is childcare. the cost of all types of childcare has risen much faster than overall inflation. the cost of childcare can affect the real increase in disposable income gained by a parent taking a job or working for more hours. this can affect families ' living standards directly and also indirectly by influencing whether parents work at all, what jobs they take and how much they work."", ""let me make my introductory remarks, and then i will give way. let me draw members ' attention to the three key reasons why we support the replacement of childcare vouchers with tax - free childcare. first, the government believe that childcare vouchers are unfair. tax - free childcare is fairer and better targeted than the voucher scheme. for example, only about 5 % of employers offer vouchers, which limits their reach to about half of working parents, not to mention that self - employed parents are completely excluded from the scheme, which pays no regard to the number of children in each family and disadvantages lone - parent families. secondly, tax - free childcare has a broader reach. it is open to all working families with children aged under 12 that meet the earnings criteria. that ensures that families who were excluded from childcare vouchers can be brought into tax - free childcare, and benefits families with the highest childcare costs - namely, most of those with young children. thirdly, tax - free childcare is simpler to use - i will come to the it issues that members raised. employers usually pay third - party providers to administer childcare voucher schemes. the government do not believe that paying third - party providers is a good use of taxpayers ' money. some a£220 million has gone on such administration since the scheme began. a voucher scheme is therefore an ineffective way of delivering support to families. under tax - free childcare, parents manage their own accounts online. the case for change is clear, as it was to the labour party when it announced at its 2009 conference, when it was in government, that the existing system would be shut down. i will now happily give way to the hon. lady."", 'it would be helpful if hon. members did not just make up statistics and facts as they went along, as we just heard from the hon. lady. hon. members should listen to us regarding the support that we are now providing to claimants. as i said, it is a topsy - turvy world. there was a ding - dong when the opposition were calling for the changes. now that we are introducing the changes, we are back to another ding - dong and they do not want the changes - but never mind. i turn to the regulations concerning national insurance contributions and childcare. these regulations align the tax and national insurance treatment of employer - supported childcare, where parents opt into the new tax - free childcare scheme. they remove the national insurance disregard to new entrants to the scheme, once the relevant day has been set. they are vital to ensure that the tax system operates fairly and consistently and that the government can target their childcare support effectively. for many parents, being able to afford good - quality childcare is essential for them to work and support their families. that is why we are replacing the childcare vouchers with tax - free childcare, which is a fairer and better - targeted system. tax - free childcare is now open to all eligible parents, who can get up to a£2, 000 per child per year to help towards their childcare costs. more families will be able to access support through tax - free childcare because only about half of employed working parents can access vouchers, and self - employed parents were excluded from vouchers. therefore, 1. 5 million families are now eligible for tax - free childcare compared with about 600, 000 families currently benefiting from vouchers.']"

women must have confidence when reporting rape that they will be believed and taken seriously, and that they will have justice. there has been a 72 % increase in the number of cases that have been administratively finalised - meaning the police have closed them after receiving advice from the cps. a guardian article on 24 september quoted a whistleblower who said that prosecutors were being told toa€œditch ' rape cases to improve figuresa€. that advice could severely limit victims ' access to justice and lead to cases involving younger victims, students or those with mental health issues being less likely to result in a charge. the overwhelming majority of rape victims still choose not to report to the police for fear of not being believed, yet the prevailing narrative in some sections of the media is that lying about rape is common. the opposite is true. only 17 % of those who experience sexual violence report it to the police, according to figures from the office for national statistics for march 2017. the cps estimated in 2012 that only 3 % of the 1, 149 cases heard may have been malicious. juries view evidence through the lens of prevailing stereotypes shared with the wider community. rape myths still dominate in our culture, including that a woman who has drunk a lot cannot complain if she is raped, that it is rape only if someone has injuries, that real rapes are done by strangers in alleyways, that it is a crime of passion and that women invite rape by what they wear. research shows that stereotypes about how rape victims are expected to behave remain prevalent in society and, by extension, in juries. there is still a lack of understanding about why a woman might not report an assault immediately or might not fight, or how a victim of a sexual assault might behave in the immediate aftermath of an attack. there are still huge gaps in the public understanding about what sexual consent actually means.""]"

almost 5, 000 a day. in the time allocated for this debate, 582 people will lose their lives to a curable disease - that is perhaps the most outrageous fact of all. tb is curable, and has been for more than 50 years. every death from tb can be, and should have been, avoided."", ""i strongly agree with the hon. gentleman that the diseases must be treated together. however, great progress has been made on tackling aids, partly because of the tremendous new tools available. by comparison, less progress has been made on tuberculosis. last year, 1. 7 million people died of tuberculosis. that is more than aids and malaria combined. the single fact that most people do not realise is that tuberculosis is now the world ' s deadliest infectious disease, and it deserves more attention than it gets. some 10 million people globally are falling ill each year as a result of this disease. tb was declared a global health emergency by the world health organisation 24 years ago. since then, 54 million people have died. that is not a great advert for the declaration of a global health emergency. three years ago in new york, the world ' s leaders set the sustainable development goals. target 3. 3 was to eliminate these major epidemics in 15 years. at the current trajectory, tb will not be eliminated for 160 years, so another 28 million people will die in the sustainable development goal period alone, costing the world economy $ 1 trillion cumulatively. middle and lower - income countries will be the most severely hit, with lower - income countries experiencing a reduction of something like 2 % of their gdp. on top of this, there are new threats. i mentioned that tb strikes when immune systems are compromised, and they can be compromised in new ways, including by the acquisition of diabetes. in indonesia, tb is striking people with diabetes, which is a growing problem. above all - this should concern the house greatly - is the growing risk of drug resistance. tb is the only major drug resistant infection that is transmitted through the air. it is already responsible for one in three deaths worldwide from all forms of drug resistance."", 'i am pleased to be able to speak in this important debate, and i am grateful to the right hon. member for arundel and south downs ( nick herbert ) and the hon. member for ealing, southall ( mr sharma ) for securing it. the fact that tb continues to kill more people every year than any other infectious disease is appalling. we have enjoyed a harmonious and well - informed debate, and i am grateful to the right hon. member for arundel and south downs for his tremendous summary and history of the issue. i have a bit more history for the house. first, though, i would like to give the scottish picture. tb levels in scotland are relatively stable and low. it accounts for between eight and nine cases per 100, 000 of the population and is a contributing factor in about 40 deaths a year - although any death is a death too many. archaeological records show signs of tuberculosis in the remains of ancient mummies, and on this very day 689 years ago, robert the bruce, king of scots, is alleged to have died of tuberculosis. tb has killed more people than any other disease in history. the modern scottish government are playing their part in tackling global challenges, including epidemics and health inequalities. since 2005, the scottish government have committed at least a£3 million a year towards funding international development work. this was initially focused on malawi to reflect 150 years of collaborative development between our two countries. in 2017, that was increased to a£10 million a year. tb is a major public health problem in malawi, and multi - drug - resistant tb is an emerging issue. as mentioned, there is also a significant link between tb and hiv, with more than half the cases in malawi being infected with both.']"

i mean giving us a simple answer on whether consumer debt is higher or lower. my understanding from bank of england and office for budget responsibility data is that consumer credit - unsecured loans - is up by 19 % since 2010. car financing - a huge new area of secured personal debt - has added a£30 billion in the same timeframe. student debt under this government has doubled to nearly a£100 billion. in real terms, there has been a 7 % increase since 2010 in consumer personal debt - the second highest figure in the g8 economies after that in canada. some clarification on that point would be welcome. it is estimated that over 8 million adults in the uk struggle with problem personal debt - the issue we are debating today - resulting in bankruptcy or individual voluntary arrangements. many people are in that situation because of unexpected life events, be that a job loss, an illness or a breakdown in relationships. the debt charity step change, which has been mentioned on multiple occasions in the debate, estimates that 60 % of its clients were able to stabilise their financial position after a voluntary freezing of interest charges and enforcement action by their creditors, so it is clear that a breathing space scheme can make a real difference to the lives of people struggling with problem personal debt."", 'i completely agree with my hon. friend. the idea is that this is just a problem for a few hundred thousand people, but debt, worrying about debt and the causes of debt are mainstream concerns in this country. debt management, debt advice and the work of citizens advice is very important, but i also believe that, when we see these problems growing again, there is a role for us to step in before they get any worse. i made a call to action several years ago about payday lenders. we did not listen then until it was too late. i hope the government will listen now. we know that not everybody is struggling, and that britain is a nation of contrasts, where some people have seen their wealth balloon because of property and pension rights. however, we also know that there are too many for whom debt is just everyday life. it is debt on basic payments - on food, rent and travelling to work costs. we know that 25 % of the uk population now struggles with debt. not everybody is in trouble, but enough are, and the reason is the nature of the products they use to deal with their debt, particularly credit cards. i hope the minister will understand why we need to act, because credit cards are the acceptable face of modern debt for people. all of us have one ; i am sure if members were to open up their wallets and purses, they would have, if not one, then maybe two or three with them. there are 30 million cardholders in the united kingdom. indeed, the financial conduct authority has been investigating the credit card market.']"

only a small number live in that very important community - and convincing him to leave because the back windows had dirt coming in and he was at risk of being crushed if he stayed in his own home. as the hon. member for angus mentioned, there are challenges in dealing with insurance companies. there is no doubt that we have significant challenges in coastal erosion the length and breadth of scotland and beyond, and it is vital that all the governments of the uk work together. i want to set the record straight on what the scottish government have done. i hope the hon. lady will be aware of the a£42 million a year that the scottish government have made available via the capital settlement since 2008 - that is, a£420 million - to enable local authorities to invest in flood prevention and coastal erosion works.', 'i thank my hon. friend for his intervention and i absolutely agree. there are huge studies going on in my constituency as well, because we need to do the groundwork, but we also need to have the funding ready for when those studies complete, so that we can go ahead with the work that needs to be done. of course, when it comes to coastal erosion, the waves do not respect local authority boundaries. erosion affects areas up and down the coastline and different local authorities face common and related problems. this is not something that should be left to local authorities alone ; there is space for a much more joined - up approach to erosion at all levels of government. however, such action must also be timely. i do not want to see montrose ending up as a cautionary tale for other parts of the coastline. unfortunately, the scottish government are risking that happening by leaving the implementation of further solutions to the 2022 to 2028 six - year plan for flood risk management. angus cannot wait until 2022, or until any time between 2022 and 2028. even by 2022, swathes of the angus coastline will have been lost. the risk of flooding and erosion to montrose, arbroath and other coastal communities in angus will be even more serious than it is today, and existing defences are being put under increasing and unbearable strain. it is the responsibility of local authorities, the devolved administrations and the uk government alike to start working together on the issue as a matter of urgency, so that we can quite literally hold back the tide that threatens so many of our coastal communities. the government are due to publish their updated national flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy next year, and within that i ask the minister to consider ways to make that work happen, ensuring that everyone involved in protecting our coasts around the whole uk is working effectively together.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered coastal erosion. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir david. the future of britain ' s coastline, and of our coastal communities, is finally getting the political attention that it deserves - not a moment too soon. from the need to curb plastic waste to prevent environmental damage to our shores to the opportunities that brexit presents for reviving our long - struggling fishing communities, britain ' s coasts are coming to the forefront of the political agenda. i am glad, because if our coastal communities are to benefit from this renewed focus on their future, we need to act now to ensure that they have a future. coastal erosion threatens large parts of britain ' s coasts and puts houses, businesses and entire communities at risk of flooding or, in some cases, total destruction. many hon. members will be familiar with this issue, as coastal erosion threatens about 17 % of the uk ' s coastline, specifically along the east coast. the environment agency estimates that more than 700 properties in england could be lost to coastal erosion by the 2030s, while in scotland, erosion is believed to pose a risk to a fifth of the coastline and the erosion rate has doubled since the 1970s. in 2013 and 2014, storms and extreme tides caused erosion that experts believed would never happen, but it has happened, and even quicker than they thought as it occurred almost overnight. businesses and individuals are increasingly concerned about the impact of the increasingly rapid degradation of our coastline. our coasts are vital areas and hubs of economic activity. as well as the obvious tourism draws, they are home to much of our crucial infrastructure. in scotland, the soft coastline, which is about 19 % of the total, and which is most at risk, includes roads, railways and scotland ' s water network.""]"

we do not even have that north of the border. pregnancies for women with pku are extremely high risk. we have a slightly odd fail - first approach in this country, which can lead to serious defects and lifelong disabilities for children if they survive the pregnancy. the cost to the nhs of treating those disabilities over the life of the child is significantly more than the cost of kuvan for the mother during pregnancy. we have an odd approach to cost - effectiveness when looking at medicines in this country that i think we need to reassess. that is not only true for kuvan ; we have seen it when talking about orkambi and for various other issues.', 'i absolutely agree. i hope that one of the good things that will come out of this debate is that the buck stops being passed, and the assessment gets done as quickly as possible. it is so important for people to have access to this drug ; we need that to be sorted. there is evidence that for a significant proportion of people with pku - about 25 % - this drug can significantly improve their condition. it does not cure it, but it does make it much easier to deal with the dietary issues, which have such an impact on the way people live their lives. despite the drug having been around for so long, nhs england has only recently considered it for the management of pku. the drug has now been referred to nice for assessment and technology appraisal. the appg on pku recently heard from nice about the process, but there is concern about the timescales and how the benefits of the treatment will be assessed. understandably, there is huge frustration on the part of the pku community that there are children and adults who could be benefiting from kuvan now, and there is substantial evidence to support its benefits. there is a particular issue about prescribing kuvan for pregnant women with pku, who can understandably find it hugely difficult to control their diet, and who fear the effect of any problems on their unborn child. while there is a 2013 commissioning policy in place that allows kuvan to be prescribed to some pregnant women, it can be difficult for women to be prescribed it in a timely way. some people, some of whom are in this room, have had access to kuvan through individual funding requests, or on a trial basis. those people have found real benefits from the drug. my constituent archie, who is here, started on the treatment earlier this year.']"

definition of gender is already happening. organisations seem to be ahead of the law, which the government may or may not be about to change. there is a particular concern about what is going on in schools with children.', ""i am sure the hon. gentleman ' s comments will slightly reassure the transgender community. the uk ' s legislation is so out of date that we are no longer considered a world leader on lgbt + rights. we were once no. 1 -

in other words, spitting alone - can constitute a common assault. that is true of the criminal justice act 1988, and spitting at an emergency worker of any kind should constitute an assault under this bill. my other amendment - amendment 3 - relates to sexual assault. the major part of the bill introduces an aggravated offence ; that is to say that the bill lists a series of different offences that, when perpetrated against an emergency worker, will be considered to be aggravated. when i drew up the bill, i was primarily thinking of physical violence towards emergency workers. but the truth is that, since i have been working on the bill, my hon. friend the member for halifax and i have received lots of representations, particularly from health service workers, about the sexual assault of ambulance workers, nurses, mental health nurses, doctors and others. one difficulty, both for the government and for us, has been that these statistics have never been gathered by nhs protect, which no longer exists anyway. however, the numbers of such incidents reported by the trade unions working on this matter are quite dramatic, particularly given that the figures show increases. since 2012, such incidents are up 143 % in the east of england ambulance service ; up 40 % in london ; up 133 % in the north west ambulance service ; and up 1500 % in northern ireland.', ""absolutely. in return for the hon. gentleman ' s sense and solidarity in not pressing the amendment, we will focus on making sure that the relevant authorities, particularly the cps, are clearly instructed to consider spitting as included under common assault. i hope that in a small way this speech in the house of commons will re - emphasise, in case anyone is in any doubt, that it is parliament ' s intention that spitting should always be included within the offence of common assault. that brings us to the amendment and various new clauses tabled by my hon. friend the member for shipley, which would further increase the penalty for assaulting emergency workers, police officers and prison officers. this is a complex set of new clauses. new clauses 1 and 2 relate to the existing law - in particular the police act 1996, as it relates to a police officer in the execution of their duty - and seek to do two things. the first is to increase the maximum penalty from six months to 12 months. on that, we respectfully argue that if the bill passes today, we will have already increased to 12 months the maximum penalty for such an assault on a police officer in the exercise of their functions. it would therefore be unnecessary to further amend the police act. the aim of new clause 2 and amendment 9 is to double the maximum penalty from 12 months to 24 months either by amending the police act or dealing with the criminal justice act 2003. the government wish to resist this approach because we have to weigh up two principles. on the one hand, we believe very strongly that emergency workers are entitled to a particular form of respect and protection because they work on our behalf - they provide services to us ; they represent us."", 'there are two aspects to the bill. the first is the offence of common assault, which i think is now drawn in such a way that the courts will be able to circumvent some of the arguments that have thus far been used to prevent any kind of successful prosecution. the second aspect relates to the aggravated offence, and the hon. gentleman is absolutely right that we have not included every single offence in the world. if amendment 3 is accepted this morning, i think that we will have included all offences that could relate to emergency workers. the minister was right to say that it is important that we take cognisance of the fact that, with this bill, we are saying that emergency workers are going to be treated slightly differently in law from the rest of the wider public. it is not that i want to create great hierarchies in society, with some people being more important than others ; it is that emergency workers are suffering these attacks and assaults because they are emergency workers, and that places a greater onus on us to ensure that they have the protections that they need. i return to amendment 2 and the question of whether spitting is common assault. the sentencing council has in recent years looked at whether spitting increases the culpability and seriousness of the offence, and it removed spitting from each of those categories in 2012. quite a lot of magistrates and judges have now started to say that this is one of the primary reasons that there has been a deflation in the number of successful prosecutions and in the sentences that are handed down. i regret the fact that spitting was removed by the sentencing council and hope that it will revisit that decision in the near future. i hope that the minister might also be able to say something about how we can ensure that the courts take spitting seriously as a part of common assault offences.']"

led forum the spotlight was on skills and on the barriers that prevent businesses recruiting people. it particularly looked at the barriers around the skills and training programmes in essex and the demands and challenges for the future workforce who are being trained. we need highly trained people, but the lack of flexibility within the training and provider landscape was clearly on display in the discussions that we had.', 'i beg to move, that this house has considered skills devolution in england. what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, mr bailey. i hope to have the pleasure of hearing your speech later. i am grateful to the backbench business committee for granting this debate on skills devolution in england. i am especially grateful to the members here from outside london, as i am keen to hear about the reality in their constituency regarding how we can tackle the national skills gap as flexibly as possible. across our country, we face an enormous challenge in ensuring that we have the skills that we need to operate the economy, and that we are doing all we can to enable people to secure such skills, and support them in doing so. the issue is particularly acute in london, where my constituency is, but it also exists in the larger cities throughout the country and, indeed, in the regions, and the situation has worsened since 2010, when further education colleges faced cuts -

and by the all - party group for greater manchester, with which we have done work on this - and the recommendations outlined in our report, a€œbridging the skills gapa€, which i recommend colleagues read. significant steps have been taken since the devolution project started in 2000, but there is a pressing case for specific devolution in this area, and a need to explore ways in which such devolution can be achieved in regions that do not have devolved assemblies or metro mayors.', 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr paisley. i congratulate the hon. member for hornsey and wood green ( catherine west ) on securing the debate. we do not have enough time to cover everything. it has been a fantastic debate, and it is useful for me to hear from individual members. as the shadow minister said, there is a lot of cross -

changing climate. to give some background on how serious the situation is, the skills for life survey in 2011 reported that 43 % of people were found to have literacy skills below level 2 - a good pass at gcse - and 78 % had numeracy skills below that level. of the respondents, 15 % were found to have the literacy skills of an 11 - year - old or lower - an estimated 5 million people - and 49 % were at that level for numeracy. therefore, it is estimated that 17 million people have the numeracy skills of an 11 - year - old or lower. according to a 2017 lloyds bank report, 11. 5 million people in the uk are classified as not having basic digital skills. however, increasing numbers of young people are now leaving compulsory education with good standards of english and maths. in 2016, just over 71 % of 19 -

it is prison staff on the ground, working in unsafe conditions and at increased risk of attack ; the prisoners in their care ; and society as a whole. the cuts have led to dangerous situations in our prisons and have cost lives. the howard league report of 2016, a€œpreventing prison suicide, a€ damningly concluded thata€œstaff shortages have increased the risk of suicidea€in our prisons. there was a cut of almost 7, 000 frontline officers - austerity measures. was there a risk assessment prior to the prison officer reduction of 7, 000? i very much doubt it. i would like to see it, if there was one."", ""that is a well - made point. prevention and looking at early diversion and picking up mental health issues where they are the significant issue at play in someone ' s offending is crucial. assessment is more difficult for prison staff and mental health staff in a short - stay prison. i hope the minister will look at that. there is a high volume of prisoners in short - stay prisons. they come and go in a very short time and it is difficult to get all of the services properly in place, so that will need resourcing. it would help to address those issues. co - morbidity has been raised, which is extremely important. we have already heard that many people develop drug problems in prison. that is in fact true and much more must be done to prevent drugs coming into prison, but we also need substance misuse programmes in prison and we need to be mindful of liaison with drug and alcohol services on release, because one of the greatest risks of overdose is when someone has come off drugs in prison and then starts again as soon as they leave. so that is another area of vulnerability. we must look at particularly vulnerable offenders and services for women and young offenders. we also need an increased awareness of autism in prison. there is a high risk of suicide within that community, particularly if they are incarcerated. in my experience, far too many of our veterans go into prison. we are failing them, frankly. they have experienced conflict and high levels of trauma, so we really need services and programmes that support them when they come back from active duty. we must prevent them from feeling they are no longer able to cope and committing offences. will the minister also address the availability of programmes in prison for mental health coping skills, cognitive behaviour therapy and managing mental illness programmes? what progress has there been on that?"", ""i absolutely do. the institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience at king ' s college london estimates that more than half of prisoners may have common mental disorders, including depression, post - traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, and believes that 15 % of prisoners have more specialist needs. those are significant figures, but guesstimates are not good enough. the most commonly used estimate, which is that 90 % of prisoners have mental health issues, dates from 1998 - 20 years ago. the government have no idea of the scale of the problem. the ministry of justice must address that to plan services and meet needs. the national audit office has recently stated : a€œgovernment does not collect enough, or good enough, data about mental health in prisons, which makes it hard to plan services and monitor outcomes. a€it particularly criticised nhs england for the data collected, whicha€œdo not measure outcomes for prisoners, continuity of care or service quality. a€how damning! this failure to monitor poor mental health levels and the mental health services provided in prison simply would not happen in the outside world. it is costing our citizens their wellbeing and sometimes their lives. let us remember, it is also costing the taxpayer. the lack of knowledge about prisoners ' mental health exists at all stages of the cycle : on entry to prison, a point raised by my hon. friend the member for stretford and urmston ( kate green ) ; during their stay in prison ; and after they leave. this means that future prison needs, present prison needs and community needs, and consequently budget requirements, cannot possibly be accurately planned for. for instance, what consideration was given, and finance afforded, to the detained historical sexual abusers?

case scenario. that reflects the very challenging operating environment in eastern drc, which is a heavily populated area affected by insecurity. for example, last weekend an attack by armed groups on a monusco base was close to where a vaccination team were staying. thankfully, none of the ebola responders was injured, but they were moved to goma for a short period and vaccination activities had to be paused for a day. the scale of the response is also challenging. in addition to the 373 confirmed and probable cases, the drc government, supported by who and other implementing partners, is trying to trace some 4, 400 contacts on a daily basis. however, there is some encouraging news. the response is enabling faster detection of cases, laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of the spread of the disease.', ""first, i thank the minister for giving me advance sight of her statement. i share the government ' s deep concern about the outbreak of ebola in the democratic republic of the congo, and i am pleased to hear that a£25 million of uk aid has been given to the response. we hope that it goes some way to containing this deadly outbreak. in addition, supporting neighbouring countries to prepare to tackle the disease is fundamental and welcome. in 2014, we learned the hard way what happens when action is not taken fast enough to halt the cruel and deadly ebola virus. we all remember with great sadness how too many people tragically lost their lives in west africa, and none of us will ever forget the fear and chaos that the virus wreaked on the affected communities, and indeed right across the globe. i am sure we all agree that we must act now to avoid a repeat of those horrific scenes, and help the drc to contain this outbreak. with the world health organisation reporting that 213 people have died since 1 august in the drc, and the humanitarian agency ma©decins sans frontia¨res confirming 366 cases, let us be sure that dfid steps up and ensures that the uk plays a crucial leadership role alongside the international community in responding to this outbreak, just as we did in sierra leone four years ago. however, while emergency humanitarian response is an integral part of dfid ' s work, i am sure the minister agrees that prevention is better than emergency response. while we send aid to drc, we cannot and must not turn our backs on providing the long - term support that will ensure countries across the global south have appropriate health systems set up in the first place. it is deeply disappointing, therefore, that the minister ' s department dropped health spending from 18 % of dfid spend in 2014, to 12 % in 2017."", 'i will come on to the lessons learnt since the outbreak in sierra leone in a moment. however, i am sure that i cannot possibly have heard from the opposition front bench a statement to the effect that having a strong private sector is somehow in conflict with having the revenues needed to provide strong health systems around the world. i hope that that is not the considered position of those on the labour front bench. while spending on strengthening health systems around the world, particularly in some of the poorest and most fragile affected countries, it is important that we in the uk recognise the important role of growth and job creation in the ability of those countries to generate their own tax revenues so that they can continue to strengthen their own health systems. we think that that is the most important way to approach worldwide development. i digress from the topic at hand. the hon. lady mentions the outbreak in west africa. i draw the attention of the house to progress and lessons that have been learned since that outbreak. first, the importance of reacting quickly has been taken into account, both in the first outbreak in the drc earlier this year, which i am glad to say has been brought under control, and in this outbreak. importantly, the uk has ensured that the who has the resources it needs as soon as it needs them, because this is a clear case of where a quick reaction will save lives. one major milestone that has occurred since the outbreak in west africa is that the world has developed an experimental vaccine, which was deployed for the first time this year in the drc. it proved to be effective in the first outbreak. as i said, 31, 000 people have been given the experimental vaccine so far in this outbreak. one real challenge, however, is that this outbreak is in a conflict -

operation is therefore actively supporting business and tourism by removing a barrier to people ' s life choices. arguably the greatest beneficiaries of these arrangements are our citizens who live on the continent, many of whom are enjoying their golden years in the sun. the framework put in place by the bill will ensure that the secretary of state has the necessary power to maintain or negotiate arrangements in any brexit eventuality. one of my constituents recently emphasised the importance of having these arrangements. his grandmother, who is now over 80, lives alone in france. a few years ago, she had a car accident that left her seriously injured. she required an operation and spent over a month in hospital. that was followed up by time in a convalescent home. all that care would have cost a small fortune but, luckily for her, she enjoys healthcare under the european health insurance card s1 route. access to that is fundamental to her and to the other 190, 000 pensioners like her, particularly as their health needs may increase over time. the bill should calm the anxieties of our citizens abroad. it will also save the taxpayer money."", 'i am grateful for this opportunity to close the debate on behalf of labour. it is clear that members on both sides of the house understand the importance of the bill. the uk currently enjoys reciprocal agreements for the provision of healthcare with all the nations of the european union. under existing arrangements, the healthcare of 190, 000 uk state pensioners living abroad - principally in ireland, spain, france and cyprus - and their dependent relatives is protected. in addition, uk residents who visit the eu or the european economic area on holiday or to study may use the european health insurance card to access healthcare for emergency treatment and healthcare needs that arise during their stay. anyone who is ordinarily resident in the uk qualifies for an ehic and 250, 000 claims for medical treatment are made each year under this scheme. by the same token, eu nationals visiting the uk can use their ehic to receive free care from the nhs for any emergency healthcare needs and for healthcare needs that arise during their stay. i am grateful to the hon. member for chelmsford ( vicky ford ) for reminding the house that the card does not cover repatriation and other associated expenses, but visitors to the eu can currently be reassured that their immediate emergency costs will be met. that is something that we would seek to protect. by means of the s1 form and the ehic, current arrangements also provide for the healthcare of employees of uk companies and organisations working in the eu and the eea, as well as for that of frontier workers living there, and vice versa. importantly, the agreement also provides funding for uk residents to travel overseas to receive planned treatment in other countries - for example, for procedures unavailable in the uk within a medically justifiable timescale, or to return home to give birth.', 'i beg to move, that the bill be now read a second time. this is a short bill, with six clauses, to enable continuity of healthcare for british nationals and eu citizens after britain leaves the european union. it is clearly in the interests of the british public to ensure reciprocal healthcare arrangements continue when we leave the eu, whether that happens through an agreement with the eu itself or through individual agreements with eu member states. by enabling us to implement those arrangements, the bill will help us to help nearly 200, 000 british pensioners living in eu countries to continue to access the medical treatment that they need, and it will mean that the hundreds of thousands of british citizens who require medical treatment each year during holidays in europe can still be covered for medical assistance when they need it. the bill will help to ensure that uk nationals who live and work in eu countries can continue to access healthcare on the same basis as local people. it will mean that eu citizens can be covered for reciprocal healthcare here, so that the uk continues to be a place tourists want to visit and vital workers, such as our nhs workforce, want to live in. the bill will also mean that we can continue to recover healthcare costs from europe as we do now.']"

corruption drives, clean water initiatives and huge investments in public infrastructure projects. as we look forward to the next 20 years, we should pause to remember the past 20, and how important the principles of the joint declaration are for the flourishing of hong kong ' s economy and society. the dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit of the hong kong people has allowed hong kong to flourish under the joint declaration. there is no reason why that should not continue. the uk - hong kong relationship has deepened. more than 600 uk businesses with registered offices in hong kong, an export market worth a£8. 6 billion and a uk investment stake of more than a£33 billion are clear signs that trade is booming. in terms of academic and cultural exchange, more hong kong students are enrolling at uk universities than ever before, which is an achievement to celebrate. in part, the relationships we form with students, young people and young democrats redouble our efforts to commit ourselves to a more socially just society based on individual freedoms and human rights. we are all aware of the high -

a€ as safe as going to a football match? as safe as travelling on the tube? as safe as flying in an aeroplane? those activities are safe, but, like patient care, nothing is ever 100 % safe. we need to ensure that care is as safe as it possibly can be, and that there are processes in place to learn from mistakes. no party has a monopoly on wanting to make the nhs as good as it can be, and all of us know that the increasing demand and complexity would make healthcare a challenge for any government. during my career, there have been significant improvements in patient safety, the most important of which is probably the establishment in 2009 of the care quality commission, with its ofsted - like reports. by 2017, it had inspected every trust, primary care and adult social care provider, and it continues to ensure they are meeting the highest standards. we now also have the regular revalidation of professionals, reflective practice and case reviews, as well as child death overview panels, which review in detail all unexpected child deaths. new maternity systems have been developed that have resulted in clear progress, as seen in the 20 % fall in the stillbirth and neonatal mortality rate in england between 2003 and 2013.""]"

when will sir charles godfray ' s review of the government ' s tb policy be published? will it consider the use of vaccination as an alternative to shooting? some horrific video footage has been obtained from the badger cull area in cumbria. a caged badger was shot and took almost a minute to die, writhing in agony. the shooter then flagrantly disregarded the biosecurity guidelines, took the badger out of the cage and failed to bag it up - little wonder that the government ' s policy has not been particularly successful in reducing the spread of tb."", ""i am disappointed that the minister did not give way at the end. i think it is very unfair to characterise the situation as being the fault of the previous labour government. let us remember that it was the previous labour government who - rather controversially - actually backed the randomised badger cull tests from which the conclusion was drawn that the way to tackle bovine tb was not through a badger cull. i repeat that the body of evidence from the scientists involved in the randomised badger cull tests showed that carrying on with the badger cull could have made matters worse. we have seen over the last five years of this horrific cull, which continues, that, even putting the appalling cruelty to one side, it is simply not working. it is all very well for the minister to get up and say that various peer - reviewed reports have implied that it has worked, but the evidence speaks for itself. how can the minister stand there and say that it has worked when the proportion of tb in cattle herds is virtually the same as at the start of the cull, and when it has even spread to other areas? the government are looking in the wrong direction. i heard what the minister said, but i implore him to go back and look again at pursuing a different route, at the cattle movements, at the fraud that takes place, at biosecurity and at doing proper testing and supporting farmers in doing so, rather than expecting them to stump up for the bill. this is an appalling state of affairs. i repeat that there is no scientific evidence to support the government ' s position. public opinion is overwhelmingly opposed to the badger cull, which does not serve the farming community in any way, shape or form and certainly does not serve the interests of wildlife in our country.""]"

related murder of our late colleague in the labour party, jo cox, and between march and september 2017, there were a further five terrorist outrages, at westminster, on 22 march, at manchester arena, on 22 may, at london bridge, on 3 june, at finsbury park, on 19 june, and at parsons green, on 15 september - although, mercifully, no one was killed in that final attack. it is fundamental that our approach in legislation does not undermine the very values that the terrorists seek to attack. the rule of law has to be fundamental to our approach. i am grateful for the consensual approach that the security minister has taken on the bill and the concessions he has made. the concession in respect of the three clicks in clause 3 makes it a better bill. the concession on clause 14 and the preservation of the right to peaceful protest is very important, too, and is very much a part of what he rightly said about protecting our own values as an open, liberal and tolerant democracy. i hope that this consensual approach can now continue into the lords. as i indicated in my speech on the first set of new clauses and amendments, i am concerned that the designated areas clause came so late, and we will therefore want to subject it to scrutiny.', 'i come to this debate wanting to be positive about attempts by the government to give our police and security forces the powers that they need in the fight against terrorism and to balance that with the equal priority of ensuring that we do not hit our civil liberties and therefore give the terrorists a victory. already we have heard how different aspects of this bill will be judged by those tests. no one who witnessed the horrors in london and manchester last year can be in any doubt that we need to redouble our efforts to protect the public. the evidence is clear, and the terrorist threat across the uk remains severe. with that threat morphing into a diverse range of threats, including people acting alone, and with the numbers involved increasing, if anything, the terrorist threat for our security forces and the police is probably the most difficult it has ever been. liberal democrats will not, at this early stage, seek to oppose this bill, but ministers and those watching this debate should not take that as agreement, in full or in part, to these proposed laws. we need to scrutinise the bill to make sure that we get the balance right. it is already clear from this debate that there are serious questions whether some of these proposed laws are necessary, whether they are properly based on sound evidence and whether there are sufficient safeguards to prevent their being abused against totally innocent citizens. the government may have a job in persuading this house and the other place that these measures should pass totally unamended in the form that we see them tonight. in considering yet another piece of terrorism legislation, the house should recall the opinion of the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, max hill, when he was appointed just over a year ago. he said that he thought that the uk had sufficient offences in the fight against terrorism and that we did not need any more.']"

the promoters may not thank me for saying this - it should not be the case that, for example, the commissioners ' mates or one particular group end up finding themselves on the navigation advisory committee. however, the promoters were happy to accept the idea that relevant interests should be declared and that there should be clear processes for how that works."", ""i am pleased to respond on the opposition ' s behalf to this opposed private business. although it might not be the most conventional way to introduce legislative change, and i have heard the detailed reservations of the hon. member for christchurch ( sir christopher chope ), we are none the less satisfied that the bill makes sense, and our intention is to support the bill as it stands. although the bill is fairly narrow in scope, we acknowledge that it has important consequences for those who will be affected. we are satisfied that due scrutiny has taken place in committee and is taking place at consideration stage this afternoon. the middle level of the fens was first drained in the 17th century to reclaim an area of farmland in cambridgeshire and west norfolk. the middle level commissioners are the navigation authority for the waterways, established through a series of local acts passed between 1663 and 1874, so we appreciate that the legislative framework underpinning the role of the commissioners is in need of an update. this is not least because almost all the fenland within the middle level waterways is below sea level, and if it was not for a complex system of flood mitigation and drainage schemes managed by the commissioners, the waterways could pose a significant risk to the estimated 100, 000 people who live and work in the area. in the simplest terms, the bill will introduce a registration scheme for vessels in the middle level and allow the commissioners to bring in revenue from boat owners that will be used to improve the waterways. the environment agency, the canal and river trust and the broads authority all have similar powers in respect of their own navigations, so in many ways, the bill is long overdue in bringing the middle level into line with its neighbours."", ""members will be pleased to know that i can be relatively brief. the government support the bill, which is promoted by the middle level commissioners, a statutory corporation constituted under the middle level act 1862. we have had a good debate this evening and i commend the many probing amendments that my hon. friend the member for christchurch ( sir christopher chope ) tabled, but i believe that all the points he raised have been dealt with comprehensively, in particular by my hon. friend the member for torbay ( kevin foster ), who has a deep grasp of all the detail of the bill. the legal framework that governs the commissioners ' navigation function is made up of a number of 18th and 19th century acts, which are now considerably out of date and do not align with modern requirements or the statutory framework that is applicable to other navigation authorities. in particular, the current legal framework that governs the commissioners does not include adequate provision for the registration of vessels using the waterways or the levying of charges for the use of the waterways and associated facilities. as a result, the commissioners do not receive any income from the navigation of the waterways, which has meant that moneys raised through drainage rates and levies have had to be used to fund navigation rather than for flood defence purposes, which is contrary to government policy. the commissioners are therefore seeking to update and clarify their powers to enable them to properly regulate and fund their waterways. the powers that they are seeking are similar to those used by other large inland navigation authorities, for example the canal and river trust, the environment agency and the broads authority. i very much support the bill and hope that it will pass unamended this evening.""]"

mhra - uses that name, i will use it to cover all five of them collectively. originally, isotretinoin was marketed as a chemotherapy drug. based on the evidence of friends who have undergone chemotherapy, i am immediately warned to watch out for side effects. i do not suffer any more from teenage acne or have the urgent need to get it under control that could easily make me overcome misgivings in a bid to get rid of such a curse. the effects of isotretinoin were last debated on 3 december 2013 in this very place. i took part in that debate because i was concerned to hear about the effects of isotretinoin on the nephew of one of my then constituents. worries about the effects of isotretinoin had been debated in parliament some 10 years before that. this seems to be a problem that will not go away and for which we have no scientifically based answer. i was spurred to call this debate by a constituent who prefers to remain anonymous, but whose son - a totally happy young man - has had his life totally disrupted since taking isotretinoin for severe acne.', 'i too was expecting to come later in the order of speeches - christmas has come early for me. happy christmas to everyone, and thank you to all the staff who run this place. i have said that now, so i will not repeat it. i want to raise the subject of the danger caused by a drug called isotretinoin, which i have already spoken about - perhaps four times - in the house since becoming an mp. to date, i have to say, the collective view of the house has had little impact on actually sorting it out. isotretinoin, also known as accutane or roaccutane, is a drug used to treat severe acne primarily in teenagers - mainly boys. it has dramatic effects : it clears acne up pretty quickly, but its side - effects can be enormous. it can cause severe depression and impotence in those who use it. my concerns stem from contact with constituents, particularly one lady. she is the mother of a young man who has suffered enormously from isotretinoin. at the age of 16, he was given the drug for eight months. as a result, he suffered - forgive my language - complete erectile dysfunction, which has had a life - changing effect on him and, indeed, on his mental state. he is now in his early 20s, and it has of course had a dramatic effect on him. he has been through university, too. unsurprisingly, his mother is distraught, in particular because her son is now almost unwilling even to discuss the matter. i believe that we can all understand that. it must be very difficult for a young man to discuss such a matter with his mother. i, personally - i know i am from another generation - could not even have dreamt of talking about such a matter with my mother.']"

everyone has a part to play. as well as the rights we have as citizens to access nhs services free at the point of use, we all have responsibilities, too. individuals have responsibilities, and we want to empower people to make the right choices. for instance, smoking costs the nhs a£2. 5 billion each year and contributes to 4 % of hospital admissions. that is despite the massive reduction in smoking over the past 30 years. the next step to a smoke - free society is targeted anti - smoking interventions, especially in hospitals. as well as stopping smoking, we must tackle excess salt. salt intake has fallen 11 % over just under a decade, but if it fell by a third, that would prevent 8, 000 premature deaths and save the nhs over a£500 million annually. we are working on new solutions to tackle salt, and we will set out more details by easter and deliver on chapter 2 of our obesity plan, too. next, prevention can save money and eliminate waste. at the moment, it takes too long, with too many invasive tests, to diagnose some illnesses.', 'we need absolute transparency around health spending, and to take not only a whole - system approach but a long - term view. public health is the prevention arm of the system, and taking money out of public health has a serious impact on future spending and our ability to tackle health inequalities. it would be very troubling indeed if much of this uplift came directly from a public health cut. we need to be specific about that, and it is not sufficient to wait for the spending review to clarify that point ; i hope that the minister will be able to tell us further about what it means. people need to plan for the future, so if a£900 million is going to be taken out of public health grants, we need to know that now. when we ask the public which parts of the system they prioritise, public health tends to be at the bottom of the list. it is up to the government to look at the evidence, and they must be clear that the evidence shows that we must focus unrelentingly on the prevention arm of healthcare. that is the right thing to do, and it is where we have the greatest chance of tackling the burning injustices of health inequality, so it is an important point to address. the other aspect i want to touch on is social care. the health and social care committee has just had a sitting with the care quality commission on its excellent a€œstate of carea€ report. the report comments on a€œfragility, a€ and the report of a couple of years ago talked about a€œa tipping point. a€ the cqc told us that that tipping point has been passed for many people in social care.', ""it is not rubbish. professor sir michael marmot warned : a€œif we don ' t spend appropriately on social care, if we don ' t spend appropriately on health care, the quality of life will get worse for older people and maybe the length of life, tooa€. sadly, we have seen this across the board. despite the growing pressure on our health and social care service, the government are responsible for spending cuts across our nhs, social care and public health services. while demand continues to increase, the government have taken away vital funding, which could close the life expectancy gap. since local authorities became responsible for public health budgets in 2015, it is estimated by the king ' s fund that, on a like - for - like basis, public health spending will have fallen by 5. 2 %. that follows a a£200 million in - year cut to public health spending in 2015 - 16. further real - term cuts are to come, averaging between 3. 9 % each year between 2016 - 17 and 2020 - 21. on the ground, that means cuts to spending on tackling drug misuse among adults of more than a£22 million compared with last year and smoking cessation services cut by almost a£16 million. spending to tackle obesity, which the hon. member for south west bedfordshire mentioned as a cause of shorter life expectancy, has also fallen by 18. 5 % between 2015 - 16 and 2016 - 17 and further cuts are in the pipeline. these are vital services for local communities and could benefit their health and lifestyle, but sadly they continue to be cut due to lack of funding. how does the minister expect to close the life expectancy gap without investing properly in vital public health services? an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.""]"

it must be separate from the nhs to ensure real independence, and it must investigate and act on concerns. if a local investigation has failed or is failing, there should be a mechanism to report that to an independent body. if we get to the point where there is simply a slanging match within a trust, there will never be a satisfactory resolution, so arbitration needs to come in and look at the cold facts and the original facts of the disclosure. often, what is looked at is the process, but not whether the whistleblower was actually right to raise an issue in the first place. it is critical that whistleblowers are protected from detriment from the moment of speaking up. they should be protected during the investigation, and they must not be picked on either subtly, as the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) said, or blatantly - they must not lose their jobs. it is important that legal penalties for reprisals against whistleblowers can actually be enforced. there should be a system of redress for whistleblowers that does not involve litigation. litigation is expensive for the nhs and the whistleblower, and is utterly confrontational.']"

i think, and our committee agrees - in a far too narrow way. the charity commission guidance for students unions indicated that it would consider it acceptable for charitable students unions to comment ona€œstreet lighting near the campusa€because the issue affects students as students, and therefore fulfils their charitable purposes. the charity commission would consider it unacceptable for students unions to comment publicly on issues that do not directly affect the welfare of students as students, such as, a€œthe treatment of political prisoners in a foreign country. a€that is the charity commission ' s own example, illustrating the point raised by my hon. friend the member for stafford. the minister told our committee that the charity commission guidance shoulda€œgo further and facilitate the promotion of free speech. it should be giving students ' unions the permission to host debates about controversial issues and expose students to a wide range of viewpoints. that should be the core purpose. a€that is quite right."", ""that is an excellent example. i hope it will also encourage students to the right of karl marx, because i have spoken to a number of students who have recently said, a€œi wouldn ' t admit to being a conservative on campus. a€our committee concluded that the concept of safe spaces, having been extended to entire university campuses, is unhelpful. it is not only unhelpful. if minority views are supressed across the whole campus, but they are not views that are promoting terrorism or inciting the kind of activity i referred to earlier, the concept is actually against the law, impinging on the right to free speech under article 10 of the european convention on human rights. a number of students unions tried to argue in evidence to us that it was necessary to limit speakers who cause harm through speech - harm caused because people might find speech disturbing or upsetting. as our report says, however, this is counter or detrimental to free speech. regarding safe spaces, we say : a€œwhilst there must be opportunities for genuinely sensitive and confidential discussions in university settings, and whilst the original intention behind safe space policies may have been to ensure that minority or vulnerable groups can feel secure, in practice the concept of safe spaces has proved problematic, often marginalising the views of minority groups. they need to co - exist with and respect free speech. they cannot cover the whole of the university or university life without impinging on rights to free speech... when that happens, people are moving from the need to have a a€œsafe spacea€ to seeking to prevent the free speech of those whose views they disagree with. minority groups or individuals holding unpopular opinions which are within the law should not be shut down nor be subject to undue additional scrutiny by students ' unions or universities."", ""this inquiry is one of the most important that we have undertaken in my three years on the joint committee on human rights. as we have heard, we received some very disturbing evidence. free speech is indeed a foundation for democracy in society, and universities are places where many of tomorrow ' s leaders learn how to explore ideas in a way that prepares them to engage in and influence wider society, so it is critical that free speech is secured in universities. a key part of all students ' education is the ability to engage in dialogue and contentious debate. universities have a legal duty under the education act to secure freedom of speech within the law, both for students and for visiting speakers. if we do not prepare students to engage in dialogue in an environment that promotes free speech, there is a serious danger that we will risk promoting extremism and factionalism within wider society. only by understanding different views and beliefs and by, as one of our witnesses said, countering bad ideas with good ones, will we build community cohesion and break down prejudice and discrimination in wider society, which, at worst, as we know, can lead to violent disturbances within our local communities. that is something that none of us wants. indeed, it is one of the purposes of the prevent strategy. it is ironic that the strategy is in many ways defeating one of its key objectives in the way that it is applied at universities. i will come on to that in more detail shortly. for the record, i will set the legal scene, which the committee is now well versed in. article 9 of the european convention on human rights states that, a€œeveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.""]"

drawn carriages and submarines should have been covered by the bill - we thank them for that. some of our learned labour colleagues in the other place were more than qualified to speak about this topic, as one is a former airline pilot and another the president of the british airline pilots association. i pay particular tribute to them for their work on this issue, and we thank the government for the technical amendments that they tabled in response to the concessions that we won. i reiterate the point that our colleagues in the other place made about enforcement. we have over 21, 000 fewer police officers compared with in 2010.', 'the bill has been much improved by the persistence of our labour colleagues in the other place. i am sure that the whole house would want to join me in sending condolences to my hon. friend the member for kingston upon hull east ( karl turner ). he had been leading for the opposition on the bill, but he has just lost his father, the distinguished hull city councillor ken turner. our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family today. as no amendments were tabled, i shall highlight a few points in the bill itself. it is a short bill, consisting of two substantive and two procedural clauses. clause 1 makes it an offence to direct or shine a laser beam towards a vehicle or a person in charge of a vehicle in such a way as to dazzle or distract the person driving, piloting, navigating or otherwise in control of the vehicle when it is moving or is ready to move. it results from an amendment tabled by labour colleagues in the other place. there may be mitigating circumstances if it can be proved that the use of the laser was necessary in, for example, a rescue mission to attract attention of a pilot, or that the offence was committed by accident if the laser was being used professionally and all precautions had initially been taken to prevent an incident from occurring. the penalty will be imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. advancing the deterrent sends a clear message that laser misuse will not be tolerated. it has also been clarified that a laser beam could be a pulsed or continuous light, and it is defined in clause 3. the definition of the modes of transport to which the bill will apply has been extended, thanks to the work of my labour colleagues in the other place. the bill is an important piece of health and safety legislation to safeguard those who operate modes of transport from the effect of laser misuse.', 'five years is indeed the maximum sentence and the maximum fine is unlimited. the bill extends to the entire uk and will come into force in england, wales and scotland at the end of the period of two months beginning with the day on which the bill is passed. in northern ireland, aviation and shipping are reserved, and the provisions relating to those will come into force at the same time as in the rest of the uk. the bill is now in a better shape than when it was introduced. in particular, the creation of an offence for shining a laser at air traffic control has received widespread endorsement and is one that the government are happy to support. the bill has been a great example of the important role parliament has in strengthening legislation. i also thank those outside the chamber who have lent their expertise to this important bill. the uk laser working group, chaired by air commodore dai whittingham, the civil aviation authority, nats, the maritime and coastguard agency, the trade union the british airline pilots association, the national police air service and many others have provided invaluable advice on some very technical issues. our work in this area does not stop once the bill is passed. the bill specifically covers the risk posed by shining a laser at a person in control of a vehicle, but, as we discussed on second reading, the government have also announced new measures to tackle the sale of unsafe laser pointers. more than 150 incidents of eye injuries involving laser pointers have been reported since 2013, the vast majority of them involving children. in many of these cases, neither the children nor their parents have known the danger involved. the government will work to raise awareness of the risks associated with laser pointers, including among schoolchildren. in addition, the government have pledged extra support to local authority ports and border teams to stop high -

it is worth noting at this point that the government have in many ways been very supportive of cornwall in recent times. we are seeing record levels of investment in our transport infrastructure, and cornwall remains the only rural county to have been given a devolution deal by the government. however, when it comes to the specific matter of recognition of the cornish as a people, there is still a great deal to do."", 'i am deeply honoured to be able to make the case tonight for celebrating cornish identity and to call for the inclusion of cornish identity to be recognised in the next census in 2021. i am very grateful for the support of many of my cornish colleagues here in the house this evening. there is no doubt or debate over the fact that the cornish are a proud people who share an extraordinary history that can be traced back thousands of years. in calling for this debate to make the case for a cornish tick box for national identity in the next census, there is a risk that some may see this as some sort of gimmick designed simply to boost our tourist industry or play into a stereotype of cornish country folk. nothing could be further from the truth. although it is true to say that many of us cornish can be guilty of having a playful jibe at the english, especially those from devon - after all they do put their jam and cream on the wrong way round on their scones - this is not a whim or some notion based on a romantic view of the past. the cornish have, along with our welsh cousins, the longest history of any people in britain, dating back 12, 000 years. it is believed that these ancient people entered this isle after the ice age from the area now occupied by the basques. genetic codes indelibly mark the cornish with the dna of their ancient ancestors. it is believed that a staggering 80 % of the cornish retain this genetic marker. the cornish language, which is seeing a revival in recent times, has a 5, 000 - year history. we in cornwall have our own culture and our own ways. cornwall even has its own patron saint, st piran, whose life is celebrated on 5 march every year. we have our own flag and even our own tartan, which i am modelling so well with my tie this evening.', ""i am grateful to my cornish colleague for that intervention and for pointing out the hon. member for wycombe, who in fact attended the same school as me in cornwall, so we have a great deal in common. he makes a very good point. this is not just about people currently living in cornwall ; it is about the right and opportunity for people across the country who count themselves cornish - maybe by birth ; maybe by ancestry - to identify themselves as cornish. the point has been made that there is the option under a€œothera€ in the census to write a€œcornisha€ as one ' s nationality. in fact, in 2011 a staggering 73, 000 cornish men and women chose to do so. i should declare an interest in saying that i was one of those 73, 000 people. an interesting comparison is worth noting. those 73, 000 people represent about 14 % of the residents of cornwall. that is the same percentage of welsh residents who wrote a€œwelsha€ under the a€œothera€ option in the 2001 census. in 2001, the inclusion of a specific tick box for a€œwelsha€ increased the percentage of people identifying as welsh from 14 % to 66 %. i am convinced that if a tick box was provided, we would see a similar increase in the percentage of people choosing cornish as their identity. a dropdown menu provision for a€œothera€ is not good enough. recognition by way of a tick box will not only satisfy those of us in the far west but enhance the accuracy of the census by allowing the many thousands of cornish men and women from across the uk - the cornish diaspora - to know that they can declare their cornish identity. gleaning accurate data is surely what the census is all about.""]"

or not, depending on how they apply - for the purposes of future amendment or reform of those rights and retained law, certain aspects should be treated as primary legislation and others as secondary legislation. i think the right hon. and learned gentleman was saying that issues that fell under article 289 should be treated as primary legislation because they were of greater import, and that if we wanted to amend them again in the future we should do so by act of parliament, whereas aspects of retained eu law that related to delegated instruments under article 290 should be treated as secondary legislation, and if there were future reforms of those aspects, parliament could use the secondary procedure. it would be most helpful if the right hon. and learned gentleman could give us a little more detail about why he felt that those were the right categories to pursue.', 'i cannot give way, because i really must press on. we are committed to proper scrutiny and engagement with parliament and the public on our corrections to eu law and future changes. in addition to all the changes we have already made to the bill, there will be a presumption in favour of engagement or consultation where it is proportionate and sensible to do so. of course, departments will consult where there is a statutory duty to do so. departments across whitehall have already undertaken engagement or consultation with stakeholders for active discussions on areas where that has been proportionate and sensible, and that will only increase. most of those who have supported lords amendment 4 are well intentioned, but some must have known that it would have hugely detrimental effects on how we could deliver a functioning statute book ahead of our exit and in the future. instead of protecting the law in the crucial areas of employment, equality, health, consumer standards and environmental protection, it would weaken it. by calling this amendment a€œenhanced protectiona€, some are seeking to hide a great danger. by limiting the changes that delegated powers could make to retained eu law relating to the specified policy areas to only those that are deemed technical, the amendment would fundamentally limit our ability to properly correct deficiencies. that risks dramatically increasing the amount of primary legislation that needs to be enacted ahead of our exit, putting more pressure on this place ahead of brexit. even the changes deemed to be a€œtechnicala€ enough to be achieved through delegated powers would still face a lengthy enhanced scrutiny process, which the lords could force to be as long as the 18 months required for legislative and regulatory reform orders. in other words, our statute book could not be made ready for exit by 29 march 2019.', ""the situation is set out in detail in the written ministerial statement that we laid. both houses will have meaningful votes on whether to accept the agreement. it is my expectation that we would not ratify before that primary legislation has gone through. new clause 1 was tabled by the labour front -

chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on liver health. i have been the chairman now for some 13 years - simply because i do not think anyone else wants to take on the mantle, to be frank. when we set up our all - party parliamentary group, we looked for a celebrity to head it all, as one does, and we chose george best. the house might feel that george best was an unlikely person to head up the charity, but at that time he was a reformed character, and he did a lot of good in those early years. unfortunately, as we all know, a great toll was taken on his health and, sadly, he died. we then looked for another celebrity, and - what a joy - anita roddick of the body shop, who was a wonderful and remarkable lady, became our patron. she died in 2007. the house may know that she contracted hepatitis c from a blood transfusion in 1971 and was unaware that she was living with the disease until 2004. a routine blood test revealed the diagnosis. she was a tireless campaigner, and we owe her a great debt of gratitude, but since 2007 we have struggled to find a patron to head up the organisation as president. if colleagues have any ideas, i know our appg would be glad to hear from them.', 'of course, the hon. lady states a fact not an opinion, and i accept that, which is why i speak of the importance of primary care and of making every contact count. the people who portmans pharmacy interacts with are not all sick. people who have a hepatitis c infection or a drug -

in many ways, i am the minister with responsibility for prevention and it is the thing that i am most passionate about in our health service. as well as testing and treating those already infected, an essential part of tackling hepatitis c must be the prevention of infection in the first place, or the prevention of reinfection of those successfully treated, which would not be a smart use of public resources. nhs england and public health england, which i have direct ministerial responsibility for, are actively engaged in programmes at a local level to prevent the spread of infection. as people who inject drugs or share needles are at the greatest risk of acquiring hepatitis c, prevention services, particularly those provided by drug treatment centres, are key components of hepatitis c control strategies. clearly, the key to breaking the cycle of hepatitis c is to prevent infection happening in the first place.', ""it is genuinely a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr streeter, and to be back in westminster hall on such a quiet day in westminster. the hon. member for ealing, southall ( mr sharma ) is sadly not in his place today, but i thank my hon. friend the member for southend west ( sir david amess ) for securing and leading this debate. although he said that he was not the best person to introduce the debate, he could have fooled us because he did it very well. hepatitis c is a significant health issue in our country, and for too long it has been overshadowed by other public health concerns that, despite the superstars involved, have had higher public profiles. i pay tribute to the hepatitis c trust and the wonderful charles gore, whom i have got to know in this job. he is a colossus in this area, and has become a friend. i also thank the hepatitis c coalition - this issue has been central to both those organisations. my hon. friend mentioned lots of local services for southend residents, and a lot is going on in his constituency. few mps champion their constituency more than he does, so for his press release i will mention that screening and onward referral services are provided by the southend treatment and recovery service, known as stars. for primary care, gp practices refer people to the specialist treatment services in my hon. friend ' s much -

off - that is the context. it was also why we expressed concern in 2015 about the government ' s cuts to the bank levy and the introduction of the corporation tax surcharge, and it is why we will vote against this measure today. we will support my hon. friend the member for walthamstow ( stella creasy ), who will - i suspect forlornly - call for a review of the effects of making provisions to discount excess profits of a private finance initiative company for the purpose of calculating the aggregate of the interest allowance of worldwide groups under the provisions in part 10 of the taxation ( international and other provisions ) act 2010. we support that as a step in the right direction to tackle the whole construct and operation of pfi schemes, which was a policy announced last september by my right hon. friend the member for hayes and harlington ( john mcdonnell ), the shadow chancellor. the bank levy was not the brainchild of a conservative government. it was not introduced because the previous chancellor had been suddenly moved by public outrage about reckless decisions made by some in the banking sector who plunged us into the world ' s greatest economic crisis in modern times. that is the context for this issue."", ""as always, it is an enormous pleasure to follow the hon. member for bootle ( peter dowd ), whose speeches are always entertaining and occasionally informative. he spent a great deal of time talking about the bank levy and the various new clauses standing in his name on that topic. i wish to start by addressing the central thesis of his comments on the bank levy : his suggestion that banks are not paying their fair share, particularly as two of them received state money from about 2009. it is a matter of incontrovertible fact that banks, as organisations, are paying more tax proportionately than other kinds of corporates. it is of course right that they do, for the reason that the hon. gentleman and my right hon. friend the member for broxtowe ( anna soubry ) mentioned : they did receive taxpayer money. they pay this extra money, compared with other businesses, in two ways. the first is through the surplus profit tax of 8 % - they pay about a third more corporation tax proportionately than a non - bank corporation does. the second is through the bank levy. although the bank levy is being reduced, it will remain in force, so banks will continue to pay proportionately more tax than non - bank businesses after the implementation of this budget. that is a vital point to get across. the hon. gentleman also tried to link funding for children ' s services to the bank levy. in one of my interventions, i gave some figures on the total amount of tax that banks are paying. we can argue about why they are paying that extra tax. clearly, it is at least in part due to the surplus profits rate and to the bank levy. it may also, in part, be due to the fact that the banks ' profits have increased."", ""perhaps we can get into the nitty - gritty of this offline. the average revenue from the bank levy between its introduction in 2011 and 2015 - 16 was around a£2. 6 billion. as a result of this package, however, yield from the surcharge and the levy in 2022 - 23 is forecast to be a£3. 2 billion. by 2023, as i have said, we will have raised around a£44 billion in additional bank taxes since the 2010 election. opposition members have also suggested that our bank levy is set at a low level compared with other countries. in fact, not all financial centres have a bank levy. the usa, for example, chose not to introduce one at all, and while several eu countries introduced bank levies following the financial crisis, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between these levies as the rules for each are different. we have heard the argument this afternoon that we should reintroduce a tax on bankers ' pay. one of the aims of the changes to bank taxation announced in 2015 and 2016 is to ensure a sustainable long - term basis for taxing banks, based on taxing bank profits and the bank levy. by contrast, the bank payroll tax referred to in new clause 3 was always intended as a one - off tax. reintroducing it would be ineffective and unsustainable compared with the package of banking tax measures that we have introduced. even the last labour chancellor pointed out that it could not be repeated without significant tax avoidance. opposition members also propose that hmrc should publish a register of tax paid by individual banks under the levy. taxpayer confidentiality is rightly a core principle for trust in our tax system and hmrc does not publish details of the amount of tax paid by any individual business.""]"

as i said, passenger journeys have increased by 42 % on competitive lines, compared with 27 % on those that have no competition ; revenue has increased by 57 %, compared with 48 % ; and average fares have increased by only 11 %, compared with 17 %. the east coast main line has open access operators such as grand central trains and hull trains. other rail lines around the country would do well to replicate that model. open access operators take no support from the taxpayer. the open access model creates competition on the line, which has led to fantastic results. in fact, since that has been the case on the east coast, the main line has had the highest satisfaction ratings in the country. the east coast open access operators deliver the very highest rates : in 2015 first hull trains and grand central each had a 94 % passenger satisfaction rate, which was the joint highest score of all operators. that was confirmed in 2016 and 2017 in the passenger satisfaction surveys conducted by the competition and markets authority. in 2016, the cma recommended more on - track competition generally, either with much more open access to compete with franchises on the same lines or with multiple operators to provide services in a fully commercial environment. unlike the cma, however, the government are yet formally to declare their support for the principle of extended open access. perhaps the minister will take up the offer to do so this afternoon. open access competition has led to new routes being opened or reopened. without open access on the east coast main line, would places such as sunderland, hartlepool, halifax and bradford have the frequent, direct and high - speed long - distance services from which they now benefit? something similar desperately needs to be replicated in northern lincolnshire.', 'my right hon. friend has made an important observation. we can certainly look at ways to make tickets more fungible, but the purpose of the present integrated smart ticketing system is to enable passengers to a€œturn up and goa€, to use the latest technology and so on. as yet, it has not focused on making tickets fungible between operators, and i am sure that is something that, as the open access policy develops and as open access develops as a feature of our system, will become more prevalent. as the cma recommended, however, a greater role for open access requires robust reforms to create a level playing field between different types of operator. at present, as my hon. friend the member for weston - super - mare knows, open access operators do not pay towards the fixed costs of the network on which they operate, nor do they contribute towards the vital social services that the franchised operators that they compete with deliver. that distorts the incentives of operators and means that we cannot realise the full benefits of competition for passengers. that is why we are now working closely with the office of rail regulation on its proposals for reforming track access charges in the next rail control period, from 2019 to 2024. these reforms will see open access operators pay an appropriate amount towards the fixed costs of the network where they are able to. we support this move as a vital step in creating the level playing field between open access and franchised operators. we have also consulted on a possible public service obligation levy. such a levy would complement track access charging reform, so that open access operators would also pay towards the social services that franchises deliver to many stations. those stations would not have the levels of service they do today if left entirely to the free market, and the government offer greater passenger choice through the franchising system to deliver social as well as economic benefits.']"

the toeic - on behalf of the home office for non - european economic area students as part of the tier 4 visa. it discovered that, in some colleges, exam invigilators read the correct answers to students or supplied proxies to sit sections of the test. the provider administering the tests, educational testing service, claimed that 33, 725 people who took the test used a proxy, and it suspected a further 22, 694 instances of fraud. that abuse on such a scale was allowed to take place at a home office - approved provider was clearly a source of political embarrassment for the government and the home secretary of the day, who is now our prime minister. when immigration system abuse goes unchecked and unchallenged, it undermines public confidence in the system and the government responsible for it.""]"

run housing association in the city. it has improved the quality of life for many glaswegians over the years. michael epitomised all that was good about the labour movement and the opportunity that it has afforded for the advancement of working -

as you said, mr speaker - a practice for speakers he abolished. he started his tenure by holding a press conference - a very progressive move. he also served in the other place from 2009 - nearly 40 years of public service. you mentioned michael ' s kindness : a member told me how anyone from a working - class background was always shown support so that they did not feel out of place in parliament. a member of staff, who was also from a glasgow housing estate, told me how michael wrote to her mother saying how proud she should be of her daughter ' s contribution in parliament. to michael ' s wife mary, his son paul, his daughter mary ann and his family, we send our condolences at this difficult time.""]"

of course, there is sex education in most schools. in that case, the child would be able to access a term of sex education before reaching 16. the hon. lady is absolutely right about bullying, including bullying of children who are lgbt. a couple of things are very important and essential in that regard.', ""at that point, if the child wishes to have sex education, the headteacher should ensure they receive it in one of those three terms. this preserves the parental right in most cases, but balances that with the child ' s right to opt in to sex education when they are competent to do so. we are keen to hear as many views as possible through the consultation, and i encourage members and their constituents to respond. the consultation will be open until early november and the final regulations will be laid in both houses, allowing for a full and considered debate. this very important change to the curriculum has to be delivered well, and although many schools will be able to adapt their existing teaching quickly, it is essential that schools that need more time to plan and to prepare their staff get that time. it is our intention that as many schools as possible will start teaching the subjects from september 2019. we will be working with schools, as well as with multi - academy trusts, dioceses and education unions, to help them to do so. all schools will be required to teach the new subjects from september 2020, which is in line with the department ' s approach that any significant changes to the curriculum have a year ' s lead - in time. that will enable us to learn lessons from early - adopter schools and to share good practice further across the sector. we will be seeking views through the consultation to test the right focus for a school support package as we know that it is crucial for schools and teachers to be confident and well prepared. our proposals are an historic step in education that will help to equip children and young people with the knowledge and support that they need to form healthy relationships, lead healthy lives, and be safe and happy in modern britain. i commend the statement to the house.""]"

why should we in this house be so powerless to do anything about it? we need to raise and talk about the issue and make sure that different government departments talk to each other, and then go into the core of why the problem continues. as we have already heard, sex for rent is when a landlord solicits sex - as opposed to currency - in exchange for shelter. many arrangements are informal and thrive in the shadows, taking advantage of young people who do not initially realise that they are doing something that will envelop them in an exploitative situation. i emphasise that the underlying problem of all this is the acute housing shortage. with very high rents, people find themselves unable to find accommodation. there are also more vulnerable people who cannot get on to the social housing ladder and who then find themselves in these arrangements, which ultimately become very exploitative and distressing.', ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr pritchard. i offer my congratulations to my hon. friend the member for hove ( peter kyle ) on securing this debate and thank him for his pioneering campaign in bringing this issue to the attention of the house. rogue landlords are taking advantage of the housing crisis by offering rooms, quite openly, for free in exchange for a€œcompanya€ or a€œbenefitsa€ - or, to put it more bluntly, for sex. frustratingly, despite confirmation from the government that sex for rent is in breach of the sexual offences act 2003, there is little evidence to suggest that any action has yet been taken to punish those preying on innocent victims. i find it unbelievable - despite the government ' s assurances that they are tackling this - that the perpetrators do not even seem to hide what they are doing, and yet there seem to be no arrests. if someone goes online it does not take long to find blatant adverts : a€œfree rooms to spare for women willing to carry out household chores nakeda€anda€œflats to rent, tenants with benefits. must reply with a picture. a€that is illegal. it is sickening exploitation of people who are caught in a spiralling struggle to find the funds to keep a roof over their head, and i ask the minister how it has been allowed to happen without more thorough investigations and prosecutions. action needs to be taken not only against the landlords placing the adverts, who should be prosecuted, but websites such as craigslist, about which we have heard. on the streets, a pimp would be charged for profiting from the sale of sex, so why is this any different?"", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the offence of sex for rent. it is an honour to serve for the first time under your chairmanship, mr pritchard. i am also grateful to the minister for being here. i have known him for a number of years in different capacities, and i know this is a subject that he will have a great deal of interest in. i am grateful to have been granted the debate, because it gives us the chance to highlight a pernicious, exploitative and pervasive phenomenon that too few people are aware of and too little is being done to tackle. the issue of sex for rent was brought to my attention by lauren moss, a bbc journalist. she showed me evidence that people were accepting accommodation from landlords in return for not money, but sex. we do not have to look hard for the adverts. they are not hidden deep in secret corners of online platforms. in fact, one of the most surprising aspects of this is how open and explicit the adverts are, and how integrated they have become into the advertising landscape for accommodation. some adverts simply imply what the landlord is expecting : a€œfree accommodation for attractive femalea€. others are more explicit : a€œyou do not have to pay any rent for your stay with me in exchange for some mutual fun times togethera€. many go into much more detail about how much sex is involved : a€œyou agree sort of like a couple of times a week, pop into my room sort of thing, but as far as the apartment ' s concerned, it ' s like completely as if we ' re flatmates. it ' s all the bills, the rent, free. a€the majority of the ads are aimed at women, but i have also seen them targeting young men.""]"

year - old son, who was killed by a 2 - tonne trailer. since the bill was introduced in the house of lords in february, peers and members from all parties have made thoughtful, informed contributions on the complex issues associated with it. we have heard a lot of arguments on proportionality, on bureaucratic burdens, on cost, on scope and on timeframes, but we have also heard about a number of deaths caused by unsafe trailers. i am particularly grateful to lord bassam, who tabled the initial probing amendment on safety in the context of freddie ' s death, and who pressed the government to do what their impact assessment said they would do and seize the opportunity of this bill to improve safety through better regulation. i also pay tribute to lord tunnicliffe for tabling the amendment on report requiring the government to collate comprehensive data on trailer safety and to publish it in a report, for which the noble lords voted. there has been significant discussion and consensus on the gaps and problems in existing information on light trailers and on the degree of threat they might pose. i am pleased that the government agreed in committee to produce a report that includes a recommendation on whether compulsory registration or periodic testing of trailers weighing more than 750 kg should be introduced - that is now part of clauses 20 and 21."", ""it is an honour to follow the right hon. member for south holland and the deepings ( mr hayes ). i will try my best to emulate some of what he tried to say. i welcome the opportunity to discuss the merits of trailer registration and to highlight the rationale and importance of clause 13 ( 3 ), ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) and clause 14 ( 3 ) and ( 4 ), as amended in the house of lords, and i am grateful to the secretary of state for his earlier comments. the subsections require the secretary of state to collate comprehensive data on the number and nature of trailer - related road accidents in the uk, and to include those findings in a report. i welcome that, because the department for transport ' s current reporting methods do not give us a true picture of the risks posed by light trailers in this country. the subsections also give the secretary of state the power to introduce compulsory trailer registration and mandatory testing of trailers weighing more than 750 kg. i accept that as a long overdue step towards improving trailer safety - although it is a compromise - but my work on the issue over the past three years has drawn me to the overwhelming conclusion there ought to be a compulsory register of all trailers weighing less than 3. 5 tonnes, and that they should be subject to regular testing. i shall say more about that later. my interest in trailer safety began soon after i was elected to this place in 2015, when my constituents donna and scott hussey came to see me about their son, freddie, who had been tragically killed in january 2014. three - year - old freddie and his mum were walking along the pavement when a two - tonne trailer came loose from a land rover, sped straight towards freddie, and killed him."", ""i rise to get more clarity and commitments from the minister, specifically on road safety and reducing loss of life. it will come as no surprise to the minister that i will focus on towbar failure and substandard trailers. on the compulsory registration of trailers, i remain concerned that a non - commercial trailer weighing between 750 kg and 3. 5 tonnes can be on the road without being subject to routine safety checks. given that vehicles over 3. 5 tonnes are regularly tested, it seems logical for trailers that are, say, 3. 4 tonnes, or even 1 tonne, to be subject to regular checks. accidents with trailers of such a size could easily cause serious injury or death, as we have heard throughout the bill ' s passage. provision for regular testing would help to shape the behaviour of road users, giving them greater responsibility for the maintenance of their vehicles. some very heavy trailers, perhaps even weighing 3. 4 tonnes, sit off - road without maintenance, potentially for months or years, before being taken on a road or motorway without any formal scrutiny. that presents a potentially deadly risk to road users and pedestrians. the minister has spoken about the opportunity the bill presents for raising public awareness of safety issues. can he provide any detail of his thoughts on what an education and public awareness campaign might look like? i welcome the commitment he has given to extend testing for all trailers over 750 kg if recommended by the report provided for under clause 20, but that does not go far enough. we have an opportunity with the bill to ensure that all trailers over 750 kg are registered on a compulsory basis. such an intervention would help to prevent serious accidents and deaths on our roads. regular checks would increase the likelihood of a culture change, leading to owners of heavy trailers taking more responsibility for the safety and roadworthiness of their vehicles.""]"

solve - to make use of what you have taught them and to apply it to new situations - but it is much cheaper to simply test a child ' s ability to retain information. the crude use of league tables, combined with the growth of the commercialised testing regime, has helped to make the curriculum far more content -

a calling in life - and in erewash we have some extraordinary examples of teachers and teaching assistants who go above and beyond to give our children the very best start in life. one example is chaucer junior school, whose pupils can often be found gardening or litter picking. i joined them to pick litter, and it taught them a lesson about how important it is not to drop litter, so it is an educational activity as well. they also visit places such as parliament, which adds real value to their education. that is not down to the funding the school receives but the hard work and dedication of the staff who are willing to organise and facilitate those activities. i can cite example after example from my constituency, including english martyrs in long eaton, which was visited a couple of years ago by the minister for school standards, who is on the front bench and who tested their maths when he visited. that school regularly gets to the final of the green school awards, which means they can come down to london, go to london zoo and be part of the bigger picture that schools and education provide. sadly, the story in erewash is not all a bed of roses and students are suffering, not because of funding cuts but because of teaching time lost by politically motivated strike action.', ""i am pleased to be able to participate in this debate on schools, although i am rather disappointed by the opposition ' s motion. i have a lot of time for the hon. member for ashton -

term plan for apd. there have been a number of reviews of apd ' s efficacy, proportionality and impact on competitiveness since its introduction in 1994, and we need to situate this debate in that context. however, despite those reviews, a number of questions still have not been answered, so i hope the minister provides some indication of the government ' s thinking. as has been indicated in previous debates on this topic, the government estimate that apd contributes about a£3. 1 billion to general taxation. i am well aware that the hon. gentleman and others suggest that, if one takes a holistic view of its fiscal impact, apd may be fiscally positive on the ledger. it would be helpful to hear from the minister whether the treasury is conducting a 360a° review of apd ' s fiscal impact. i understand that pwc has carried out research, but it would help if the treasury were focused on this issue, too. in response to the comments by the hon. member for shannon, i cannot resist -"", ""other right hon. and hon. members will have to make up their minds whether the hon. gentleman is unusual, but i leave that with them. as the hon. member for belfast east pointed out, the tax does not work as an environmental incentive. it is simply an economic disincentive. the money goes into the general tax pool every year and does not go to tackle the environmental issues other than in the way that any other tax might. there is no direct funnelling of that money into environmental initiatives - otherwise there would be significant differences. as he said, all studies show that a reduction in apd would produce a net benefit to the economy. the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) said that pwc stated that if apd is scrapped, the treasury will gain. he made the telling point that a treasury report found that the uk is ranked 135 out of 136 countries in terms the cost to the traveller. that is damning of the cost of air travel through apd. he further pointed out that ireland scrapped apd in 2014 - an independent country making a decision for itself - and tourism shot up by 47 %. the hon. member for belfast east introduced a side issue, which i also thoroughly agree on, of cutting vat rates for tourism. combined with tackling apd, that would be of huge benefit to areas throughout the nations of the uk where tourism and visitor numbers are extremely important to the local economy. we support that strongly and we would commit to it if the power was with us. on the hon. gentleman ' s closing remarks, i cannot send a valentine to the tories because it certainly would not be sincere, but the comment about it being a humorous way to highlight a serious problem is valid."", ""i beg the hon. gentleman ' s pardon. i am very sorry about that. he will perhaps be even more perplexed when i mention that, rather than pound pinching, my family talked about looking after the pennies and the pounds looking after themselves. perhaps that reveals a psychological difference between lowland and ulster scots. of course, we need to look after the pennies and the pounds - that is the whole point. we need to trace exactly the impact of apd. studies suggest that the evidence about apd ' s impact on passenger numbers is mixed. as many members said, such a duty is unusual in the international context, but the number of passengers using uk airports has increased by 15 % - a substantial increase - in the past five years. of course, apd needs to be considered in the context of there being no tax on aviation fuel and no vat on domestic or international flights. there are also different levels of apd for different kinds of flights, and exemptions for children were introduced in 2015 and extended in march 2016. i will focus on four issues : the long - term viability of apd, regional competitiveness, the unequal impact of apd on different groups of britons, and environmental issues. from a revenue point of view, there are clearly significant concerns about apd ' s long - term viability. the government have moved to provide industry with earlier notice of apd changes. the rates for next year were announced last autumn. that is surely positive for industry but, as i mentioned, we have had no indication of the government ' s view of the long - term trajectory of the tax, particularly in the context of the race to the bottom occasioned by internal competition in the uk.""]"

joint enterprise has been applied in cases for more than 300 years, although it is a common law that has never been passed by parliament. the doctrine allows for more than one person to be charged for the same offence, despite the fact that they may have played a different role, or no role, in the crime. joint enterprise applies to all crimes, but in recent years it has been particularly used as a way to prosecute murder, especially, but not exclusively, in cases involving groups of young men. this is obviously a very emotive issue, particularly for families of murder victims, and no one is suggesting that those who commit murder, or who knowingly and intentionally assist in committing murder, should not face the full force of the law. however, nor should the evidential bar for serious offences like murder be lower, by virtue of presence or association with the principal offender, as we have all too often seen. indeed, there are many cases, many of which i am sure will come to light today, in which people are serving life sentences when it is clear that they did not commit murder but were found guilty under the a€œolda€ or a€œwronga€ law of parasitic accessory liability."", ""mr deputy speaker, along with the whole house i welcome you back to the chair. i congratulate the hon. member for manchester central ( lucy powell ) on securing this debate and thank mr speaker and the backbench business committee for granting it. i draw the attention of the house to my outside interests as set out in the register. we are holding this debate today because we know that thousands of people have been prosecuted under joint enterprise over the last decade alone, and we have a profound fear that some of these convictions are unsound. i am deeply conscious that behind each of these crimes lies a victim, usually murdered, with grieving loved ones whose lives have been changed for ever and ruined. my heart goes out to all those and their families who have suffered in that way. but we also know that there is a wealth of evidence that suggests that joint enterprise has both convicted people in error and wholly disproportionately affected those who identify as black, asian and minority ethnic. young people from ethnic communities have been, essentially, hoovered up for peripheral and in some cases even non - existent involvement in serious criminal acts. the supreme court ' s decision in the case of jogee has established that the previous interpretation of the law was wrong and confirmed the abolition of what i am advised lawyers call parasitic accessory liability, to which the hon. lady referred. but to date only a very limited number of joint enterprise convictions have been quashed. to find a defendant guilty of a criminal offence, a jury must be satisfied that a defendant both committed the crime and had the requisite state of mind to carry out the crime. yet the law on joint enterprise, and secondary liability more generally, was developed by the courts to ensure that all participants in a criminal enterprise could be held accountable. indeed, it has been a key tool when prosecuting suspected gang members."", 'i beg to move, that this house notes the supreme court judgment in the case of jogee and ruddock of february 2016 that the law on joint enterprise and parasitic accessory liability had been wrongly interpreted for more than 30 years ; further notes that since that judgment, the number of cases brought under joint enterprise has remained unchanged ; further notes that there have yet to be any successful appeals of cases from before february 2016 ; and calls on the government to review the use of joint enterprise and to bring forward legislative proposals to clarify the law on joint enterprise. i welcome you back to your place in the chair, mr deputy speaker, and i am sure that the whole house will join me in wishing you and your family all the best ; i know that it has been a very difficult few weeks for you. i thank the backbench business committee for accepting the application for this important debate, and i thank the right hon. and hon. members who supported that application, particularly the right hon. member for sutton coldfield ( mr mitchell ), the hon. member for bromley and chislehurst ( robert neill ) and my right hon. friend the member for tottenham ( mr lammy ), all of whom were co - sponsors of the application. i also thank the families and campaigners on joint enterprise, who are known as jengba - joint enterprise : not guilty by association - and many of whom are in the public gallery today. they have never given up in their fight for justice for their loved ones. why are we having this debate now?

the success of elite women does not facilitate the emancipation of lower - paid sisters in the economy. in fact, some would argue it prevents it. the experience of most women, after all, is that of a worker, not of a boss. our obsession with boardrooms has not only failed to close the pay gap for working - class women, but produced another kind of pay gap - the gap between women at the bottom and women at the top. professional women earn on average 80 % more than unskilled women, while the difference between professional and unskilled men is still huge, at 60 %. although a few elite women succeed, the experience for most working - class women is of a system that is completely rigged against them. it is a system in which women are on zero - hours contracts and are scared that they will not get adequate maternity pay if they want to start a family. as a proud pregnant working woman, i know that my position protects me from many of the forms of discrimination that pregnant women face in the workplace. it is a system in which women are still the main childcare providers. they represent 90 % of lone parents and are terrified that they will not get enough hours to provide for their children. it is a system in which 230, 000 jobs held by women pay less than the minimum wage.', ""i was at the same event, and a female electrician corrected me by saying that only 1 % of electrical engineers are female. as in our earlier discussion about pilots, there is no reason why more electricians and electrical engineers should not be women. let me turn to the work we are doing to help the lowest paid. the minister for women and equalities, my right hon. friend the member for portsmouth north ( penny mordaunt ), recently announced that the work of the government equalities office will be broadened to include an explicit focus on low - paid, low - skilled women, who have often been left out of the conversation, despite possibly requiring the most support, given the multiple barriers they face. the message that she wants to give, and which i echo, is that this is not a question of forgetting about directorships or the highest - paid women ; this is about multitasking and ensuring that we reflect the whole economy and women ' s contributions to it. we know, for example, that the lowest - paid women tend to feature in four industries : retail, childcare, caring and cleaning. we are looking at those sectors to ensure that the figures for the gender pay gap translate into real - life policies that have the greatest impact for the lowest - paid women. the shadow minister mentioned some figures quoted by the oecd. she will have to forgive me - obviously i am doing this on my feet - but just to put them in context, we understand that the oecd figures use a different methodology and go much wider than our gender pay gap measures. we are working with colleagues across whitehall to increase women ' s economic empowerment. in terms of government recruitment, those factors are very much taken into account when we look at contracts. i hope that reassures her. i turn now to the drivers of the gender pay gap.""]"

she has started a company called tip tap, a mobile phone app that will allow diners to give their tips directly to the waiter. they can pay the bill to the restaurant, the waiter will get out their app and then they can pay the tip to the waiter directly. that seems an example of a good solution, but i still do not quite understand why restaurant owners and others feel it is a particular hassle to facilitate that process for their workers, who are often the lowest - paid in those businesses - as i say, on average, they earn only around a£7. 71 an hour. this is a simplistic debate ;

it is not asymmetric. there will not be a hit. i promise him that when we look back on it all in five years ' time, he will not be able to see that - certainly on world growth graphs and, i suspect, on uk economic graphs - when we left the eu. it will not be a big economic event. it is a massively important political event, but it will not be a significant economic event, because joining it was not. indeed, even worse, in the immediate aftermath of both joining the eec and of completing the single market, there were very big recessions where our growth rate took a very big hit.""]"

year - old young man from my hon. friend ' s constituency : seni lewis died following restraint by 11 police officers while he was in a mental health unit. that was not an isolated incident. thousands of patients have suffered abusive restraint, with too little guidance and supervision for police and mental health professionals on how best to manage mental health crisis. the high number of injuries - 3, 652 this year, according to the women ' s charity agenda - has been compounded by the reduction in spending on mental health wards, the cuts to training budgets for support workers, and the increased social isolation experienced by people with poor mental health. all too often, the warning signs are not picked up until a patient is very ill. because of the lax reporting requirements on the use of restraint in the sector, it is likely that the available statistics under - report the extent of poor practice."", ""i beg to move an amendment, to leave out from a€œthata€ to the end of the question and add : a€œthis house declines to give a second reading to the mental capacity ( amendment ) bill, notwithstanding the need for reform to the current system of mental capacity assessments and while acknowledging the improvements made to the bill by the house of lords, because the bill underwent no pre - legislative scrutiny, it does not put the interests of the cared - for person at the heart of the bill, it enshrines a conflict of interest in relation to independent providers of health and care services, it fails to provide measures to reduce the substantial backlog of deprivation of liberty safeguards assessments and it fails to recognise explicitly the interface with the mental health act when determining which legislation should be used to authorise care or treatment arrangements. a€the issue before the house today is one of fundamental importance to us all : the individual liberty of vulnerable people. today, we are being asked under which conditions it is right to deprive vulnerable people of that liberty when they need care and treatment and cannot give their consent, and what protections should be in place when their liberty is taken away. the proposals in the bill to replace deprivation of liberty safeguards have the scope to affect the rights of a large portion of the 2 million people in the uk thought to lack capacity to make their own decisions. among them are people with dementia, learning disabilities, autism and brain injuries. whether to deprive some of the most vulnerable people in this country of their liberty should be an issue that we treat with the utmost respect, thought and care. however, i am afraid the government ' s approach to this immensely important issue has shown few of those qualities."", ""i speak as a member of the joint committee on human rights. we looked at this whole issue generally in our report in june, and we looked more specifically at the bill in october, so i declare that interest. article 5 of the european convention on human rights sets out the right to liberty and security. it says that no one shall be deprived of their libertya€œsave... in accordance with a procedure determined by lawa€. that essential safeguard applies to all those who are deprived of their liberty, not just people in the criminal justice system, and so it should. the previous system involved the deprivation of liberty safeguards, which were criticised by the house of lords committee on the mental capacity act 2005. the committee found thata€œfar from being used to protect individuals and their rights, they are sometimes used to oppress individuals, and to force upon them decisions made by others without reference to the wishes and feelings of the person concerned. a€so reform is most definitely needed. the only guidance that the mental capacity act 2005 gives to the courts is thata€œreferences to deprivation of a person ' s liberty have the same meaning as in article 5 ( 1 ) of the human rights convention. a€the supreme court, as has been mentioned, has defined deprivation of liberty in an a€œacid testa€ that covers all those who are under a€œcontinuous supervision and controla€ and a€œnot free to leavea€, regardless of their condition or contentment. it was logical of the supreme court to do that, but it has none the less meant that hundreds of thousands of people who were not previously considered as being deprived of their liberty may now be so considered, and 125, 630 people have been unlawfully deprived of their liberty between 2017 and 2018.""]"

it is about creating a balance. i would point out that not all residents in care homes have dementia. many of them do not and have a very strong awareness of their environment. they would see this as an infringement of their dignity - a dignity that they are fighting to hold on to for the remainder of their life. i take the point, but i do not think the issue is straightforward. a point was made about cctv in this building. we accept it, but we do not live here. we accept it in our lives, but if we are to make care homes a genuine substitute home for vulnerable people, we have to bear such points in mind. cctv may have a role in specific circumstances, for example where a concern has been identified, but it ought to be a last resort, implemented only with the knowledge and full consent of residents, families, staff and professional representatives, because this affects everybody, and observing would definitely affect the relationships in the home. acknowledging that it is unlikely that incidents of abuse and poor standards of care would be prevented by installing cctv cameras in communal areas does not mean that serious problems can be ignored. abuse of people in care homes, and / or poor care, shames us all. ln many ways, the issue of cctv is more of a red herring than a solution. i accept that it may have a role in some areas, and there may be justification for using it in some limited ways. however, there is widespread agreement from a range of well - respected organisations that the blanket imposition of cctv is not the answer. as the hon.']"

people do it in groups.', 'i agree with the hon. gentleman. i am glad to see him here because we missed him very much in the adjournment debate last night. i was going to send out a search party to see where he had disappeared to. shisha bars are gaining popularity among young people who do not drink alcohol, either by choice or because of their religion. there is clearly some demand for that type of space where no alcohol is served, because the options in many town and cities are pretty limited. if people want to go out, they are obliged to be in a place where alcohol is being sold and drunk, but that is not necessarily appropriate for everyone. there is a balance to be struck between the social good, where people can come together in an environment where there is no alcohol, and the harm from smoking shishas that the hon. gentleman points out. the perception that smoking shisha is cleaner and better than smoking cigarettes is a very dangerous myth, particularly for young people. the hon. member for birmingham, ladywood pointed out that one session on a shisha can be as bad for your health as smoking 100 cigarettes. that is quite stark. that information needs to be out there and well known. if the government did more to promote the public health message, that might be useful for many of our communities. the tobacco is usually fruit flavoured and slightly different from cigarettes, which can offer a false sense of security that it is not as bad for you, but smoking it doubles the risk of lung cancer and respiratory illness. it also contains all the factors that we know are harmful about tobacco and it is addictive. because of the way that shisha is consumed, people take other chemicals into their lungs from the heating and burning process. it can be more harmful than smoking. in scotland, business owners need to be licensed to sell tobacco, including shisha tobacco.']"

and what happens if by 21 january next year there is no article 50 deal or no prospect of an article 50 deal. the prime minister has consistently said, a€œtough luck ; if you don ' t like my proposed deal you can have something much worse. a€ that is not meaningful. the brexit secretary, once a great guardian of the role of this house, now wants to sideline parliament when its voice is most needed. he says that in the event that the prime minister ' s proposed article 50 deal is rejected by parliament or there is no article 50 deal, a minister will make a statement. well, i should think so - after two years of negotiation, the government bring back a deal which is rejected and a minister will make a statement. and he says that will happen not in 28 days, but in 21 days - that is democracy ; that is giving parliament a real voice. and then a further safeguard : there will be a neutral motion."", ""i will be very brief. first, i acknowledge that, in this business motion, the government have listened to representations made by both the exiting the european union committee and the procedure committee, although i gently say to the leader of the house and other ministers present that this whole process, unfortunately, has shown the government ' s marked reluctance to listen to the house, to trust the house and to share information with the house. i suspect that what the government have sown, they will reap in the vote next tuesday. secondly, i rise to support the amendment tabled by the right hon. and learned member for beaconsfield ( mr grieve ). as it bears more than a passing resemblance to amendment ( c ) that i have tabled to the motion on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration, he is probably not surprised to hear me say that. the hon. and learned member for edinburgh south west ( joanna cherry ) talked of a lifeline, and it is essential that the house of commons has the opportunity, if the deal is voted down next tuesday, to give itself a voice and to express a view about what happens next. amendment ( d ) to the business of the house motion would, as we have just heard, remove the obstacle to that, and i hope the whole house will vote for it. amendment proposed : ( d ), at end adda€œ ( 11 ) the provisions of standing order no. 24b ( amendments to motions to consider specified matters ) shall not apply in respect of any motion tabled by a minister of the crown pursuant to any provision of section 13 of the european union ( withdrawal ) act 2018. a€ - ( mr grieve. )""]"

i know i am labouring the point, but it is important - which contributed a£62 million to the economy of west wales alone and a£100 million to the economy of wales in 2016. in wales, 3, 500 people are employed in the sector, almost 1, 400 vets having graduated in the eu and settled in wales, benefiting from the ability to live, work and study in 28 countries as part of single market membership. the veterinary sector is not the only one in wales that is supported by a workforce from the eu, but leaving the single market, and potentially losing the ability to easily attract the vets that we need, will have serious repercussions. the profession is relatively small, but its reach and impact are significant. the ramifications of losing just a small percentage of the workforce could be substantial. for example, the british veterinary association has detailed the profound consequences of losing official veterinarians from slaughterhouses, where up to 95 % of vets registering to work in the meat hygiene workforce graduated overseas."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the effect of the uk leaving the eu on the veterinary profession in wales. diolch yn fawr iawn, mr hosie. it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. i am grateful for the opportunity to debate the future of the veterinary sector in wales, and particularly the impact that leaving the european union will have on it. it is a profession that does not always receive due attention, but it is nevertheless hugely important, not only to my constituency of ceredigion and other rural areas in wales but to the whole of the country. i begin by emphasising that, regardless of one ' s opinion of the uk ' s membership of the european union, we can all agree that that membership has significantly shaped the veterinary sector in several ways, including through legislation on animal health and welfare standards, the invaluable contribution that freedom of movement has made to the veterinary workforce, and the accessibility of safe, rigorously tested veterinary medicines to name but a few. those are key pillars of the sector and will undoubtedly be impacted by the government ' s decision to leave both the eu single market and the customs union. as such, it is important that the government address these challenges, to ensure that preparations are thorough, so that the veterinary sector is in robust health and is able to operate effectively in a post eu - membership climate. i know that those of us here acknowledge the importance of the veterinary profession and its particular contribution to making rural communities sustainable. a strong veterinary workforce is vital to maintaining high animal health and welfare standards, food safety standards and overall public health in wales. we should not underestimate the role that local vets play in their communities."", ""i again thank the hon. gentleman for his intervention. i wholeheartedly agree with him. it is a real asset to the united kingdom that we have such high - quality veterinary training and research. i just hope that aberystwyth university can, in the very near future, contribute to that revered status and reputation. research conducted recently by the royal college of veterinary surgeons has shown that nearly one in five eu vets are now actively looking for work outside the uk. fulfilling demand for veterinary surgeons will be essential not just to maintain animal welfare standards and hygiene, but to our trading prospects. the bva has warned that in the short to medium term, it will be impossible to meet the demand with uk nationals alone, so the profession does face the possibility of a workforce shortage and wales faces a significant new barrier to trade. the import and export of animals to third countries requires veterinary certification, and that in turn depends on having sufficient numbers of adequately trained vets. official veterinarians both certify and supervise the import and export of live animals and provide official controls at food exporting premises and border inspection posts. should the uk leave the single market and customs union and subsequently fail to enter into a form of customs union with the eu, administrative checks would apply to uk imports from and exports to the eu, as well as to any other countries that the uk trades with. the demand for veterinary certification is already increasing, and if that becomes our default trading position, the demand will only grow exponentially. nigel gibbens, the uk ' s former chief veterinary officer, recently warned that such a scenario could mean that the volume of products requiring veterinary export health certification would increase by as much as 325 %, at a time when our ability to recruit the very vets that we need to issue certificates was significantly hindered.""]"

they also have a positive impact on increasing economic productivity. widespread access to vaccines in developing countries offers many benefits, including direct medical savings by preventing illness, and also through indirect economic benefits such as educational attainment, labour productivity, cognitive development, higher income, savings, and of course investment. i could go on. to put it simply, healthy children are more likely to attend schools and become economically productive adults. vaccinating a baby benefits everyone in the long run. as all of us in the chamber will note, we have all been through the vaccination process and are of course eternally grateful for it. a harvard university study published in february in the journal health affairs modelled the health and economic impact of vaccines for 10 diseases in 41 developing countries. it showed that increasing vaccination rates in developing countries could reduce poverty."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr evans. i thank my right hon. friend the member for preseli pembrokeshire ( stephen crabb ) for securing this important debate. we must not underestimate the value of human capital to the future of developing countries. around the world, year on year, countries are still losing the talent and potential of countless people, including children, whose lives are tragically cut short by vaccine - preventable diseases. the vaccines for these diseases exist : if we want those countries to reach their fullest economic potential, ensuring people there have access to vaccination must be one of our highest priorities. vaccines are vital in every sense of the word. they ensure that as many people as possible - children and adults - live and enjoy healthier lives throughout the world. healthier people are more able to go to school and work, and to drive the growth of their countries ' economies, intellectually or physically. the logic and the evidence are clear : vaccines are a powerful force for economic development and wealth creation. a recent harvard study projected that vaccines will prevent 36 million deaths by 2030 and prevent a further 24 million people across 41 developing countries from sliding into poverty. those are staggering and extraordinary figures. they show why it is so important that vaccination is at the top of the uk government ' s agenda for international development. we must not fall into the trap of thinking that health and economy are separate ; in my view, they are inextricably linked. as the harvard evidence shows, a healthy society can evolve to become a wealthy society. i am delighted that uk governments of various colours in the past decades have recognised the value of vaccines. in 2016, the government invested a£116 million of bilateral aid towards vaccination in developing countries.""]"

it continues. the devastating impact that that has on the mental health of young people should not be forgotten. he also rightly spoke of the tragic experience of one of his young constituents, and i am sure that many more people could speak to that experience. although today much of the debate and news coverage will be about brexit and the next cabinet minister to resign, someone, somewhere, is experiencing bullying right now. whether in the playground or the workplace, bullying affects people from all different backgrounds, and those at different stages and ages in life. on behalf of the scottish national party, i fully support today ' s debate. brexit reigns strong, but we must continue to use this house to discuss important issues that affect people every day. the snp takes bullying very seriously, and believes that there is no place in scotland for prejudice or discrimination. core to that is the belief that everyone deserves to be treated fairly and that bullying of any kind is therefore unacceptable. where it occurs it must be addressed quickly and effectively. in schools, it often falls on headteachers, teachers and local authorities to decide how bullying is tackled. the scottish government expect all schools to develop and implement an anti - bullying policy, which should be reviewed and updated on a regular basis. the hon. member for cambridge spoke about the experience in england.""]"

a position backed by both the conservatives and labour - will reduce output by 8. 5 % by 2030, which is equivalent to a loss of a£2, 300 a year for each person in scotland. of course, the uk government do not agree with the figure, having conducted their own analysis of the impact of brexit on scotland ' s economy. their analysis presents an even worse scenario, with output reduced by 9 % over the next 15 years. we are at a crucial point in determining the future of our economy. we have to take into account that we are having brexit as a result of an internal debate within the conservative party that got out of hand. only one party has a clear and meaningful vision for the future of scotland ' s economy : the snp. we have looked at the issue. we have the sustainable growth commission, a suite of recommendations and a robust plan for the type of scotland we would like to see. the report calls for more investment to grow scotland ' s economy by increasing population, participation and productivity. some of that can be done now, but some of it cannot."", 'it is an honour to speak for the scottish national party on the second day of the 2018 budget debate. ten years ago last month, lehman brothers collapsed. excessive risk - taking by financial institutions created an international banking crisis, and a global downturn followed. since then, people and families across the uk have had to pay for the fall - out. there has been a decade of wage stagnation, a decade of cuts and a decade of the most vulnerable in our society being hit the hardest by tory austerity. looking forward, we are staring into the abyss that is brexit. mark carney says that brexit has already cost householders an average of a£900, and the fraser of allander institute estimates that leaving the single market and customs union would cost 80, 000 scottish jobs. after a decade of austerity, households cannot afford to lose a£900 each, and they certainly cannot afford a tory brexit. the reality is that the people of scotland are badly served by westminster. we did not vote for a tory government and we did not vote for brexit. i cannot think of a time in the past when a country has committed such a foreseeable act of economic self - harm. the chancellor does not believe that we will be better off after brexit. even the prime minister does not believe that we will be better off after brexit. we were promised a£350 million pounds a week for public services. we will not be bought off with a commemorative 50p coin.']"

i am sure colleagues across the house know about the increasing use of isolation rooms for extended periods. i believe that this is partly fuelled by the need for a cheap solution to problematic behaviour. schools do not have the resources to address the causes of the behaviour, so they treat the symptoms. even if we think, a€œthose kids deserve it. put them in isolation - it ' s good for them, a€ or some other macho comment that comes out from the government every now and again, we surely cannot believe that these children are getting any kind of quality educational experience. in fact, the evidence shows that they are being given generic online resources instead of equivalent work, so while these children are in isolation, they might as well not be in school at all. they are missing weeks of learning. how will that help them? how will that improve schools standards? i want to conclude by saying that it does not have to be this way. with adequate funding and local authority resourcing, local experts could come into schools and provide the crucial services that local authorities used to offer. i hope the hon. member for harborough agrees with me. all the specialists who are needed - speech therapists, educational psychologists, education welfare officers, school social workers ; i could go on - could be provided at local authority level, to come into schools and support every child.""]"
