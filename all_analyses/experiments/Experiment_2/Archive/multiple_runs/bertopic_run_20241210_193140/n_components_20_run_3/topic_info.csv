far from labour being vindicated, the house will remember that the pay restraint in the nhs for the past eight years was caused by the worst financial recession since the second world war, caused by a catastrophic loss of control of public finances. the hon. gentleman asks for some details. today ' s pay deal means that someone starting work in the nhs as a healthcare assistant will see their rate of pay over the next three years go up by 26 %, nearly a£4, 000. a nurse with three years ' experience will see a 25 % increase, which is more than a£6, 000 over three years. a band 6 paramedic with four years ' experience will see a a£4, 000 rise. on top of that, we are putting in a huge number of things that nhs staff will welcome, including, for example, statutory child bereavement leave and shared parental leave. yes, we are asking for important productivity changes in return, but this is about the modernisation of nhs staff terms and conditions, which is good for them and good for taxpayers. the hon. gentleman asks where the money is coming from : it is additional funding from the treasury for the nhs. it is not coming from extra borrowing. if he had been listening to the autumn statement, he would have heard that debt as a proportion of gdp is starting to fall this year for the first time. that is possible because we have taken very difficult decisions over the past eight years - they were opposed by the labour party - that have meant 3 million more jobs and have transformed our economy out of recession into growth."", ""i share the right hon. gentleman ' s admiration for the people who came here from the caribbean and contributed so much to our society in many different ways, and that admiration remains in place. i am concerned that the home office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the individual. this is about individuals, and we have heard the individual stories, some of which have been terrible to hear. that is why i have acted. that is why i have put a clear limit on the amount of time it will take to correct the situation. that is why i am so committed to ensuring that there is no cost involved. that is why i am so committed to making sure that we can work across departments. we hope to be able to get the necessary information ourselves in the same way that we are looking ahead to the eu settled status, when we will be able to engage with other departments to look at national insurance numbers. we will share things and will take the responsibility for finding the evidence, so that we can get the documents for those who need them. finally, on one other point that the right hon. gentleman raised, i am not aware of any specific cases of a person being removed in these circumstances. that is why i have asked the high commissioners if they know of any cases, and they should bring them to me. if anyone here knows of any such circumstances, they should bring them to the home office.""]"

but much more needs to be done. we are working alongside transport for the north, northern, trans pennine express and network rail on improving services and punctuality. we have asked richard george to review the performance of the region ' s rail network and to make recommendations to improve reliability, and where operators are found to be at fault, we will take action."", 'i will make some progress before i give way again. i would like to update the house on how the industry is working to improve the reliability of services. on 4 june, northern introduced a temporary timetable, including a targeted reduction in trains by around 6 % to achieve a more deliverable service. even with this reduction in service, there are still more trains running across the whole northern network than before the timetable change in may. that does not mean that there are not individual areas that still have very significant problems, and i am very conscious that many passengers are still experiencing significant disruption, but there are signs that the service is stabilising. over the first two weeks of the reduced timetable, 80 % of trains arrived on time and 4 % were cancelled or arrived significantly late, which is a significant improvement. this is not nearly good enough, but it is an improvement on what was happening before the introduction of that timetable. northern is planning to run the timetable until the end of july, when it will review and, we hope, significantly increase the number of trains running, while ensuring continued stability. stability is the most important thing for passengers so that they know what is expected, when trains are going to come and that they are going to come. officials from the rail north partnership - it is worth reminding labour members that this franchise is managed as a partnership between my department and the leaders of local authorities in the north. decisions about it are taken by the partnership board of transport for the north, and it has been considering how to respond - the shadow secretary of state says it does not exist. this is the most devolved franchise in england. responsibilities for managing and overseeing the franchise are shared through the board of transport for the north - labour members do not like it, but that is the truth. gtr is also working to increase the predictability and reliability of journeys on its network.']"

6,518,6_legal_aid_justice_court,"['legal', 'aid', 'justice', 'court', 'courts', 'judges', 'magistrates', 'bar', 'barristers', 'judicial']","[""the hon. gentleman is right that people in birmingham, and people throughout the west midlands and beyond, are looking at this situation and saying : a€œif it is the public interest for the case to be tested at the court of appeal, how can it be that only one side is being funded to do so? a€ i am not sure that i agree with him that it is easy for a lot of other people to get legal aid. in fact, the changes to the legal aid system have been a concern for a wide range of people seeking public support in their quests for justice. certainly in this case, however, it is astonishing that legal aid has been denied. ministers know that public funding has sometimes been made available outside the legal aid system. it was rightly made available for the hillsborough inquests, when legal aid was not available. i therefore ask the minister : does she agree with the legal aid agency ' s contention that it has no discretion at all to grant legal aid for the appeal court hearing? if she does not agree, will she put the legal aid agency right? if she agrees with the legal aid agency, does she also agree with my contention that it is in the public interest for both the coroner and the families to have equal resources to test their cases at the court of appeal, and that the government should therefore make available the public resources to achieve that objective outside the regular legal aid framework? beyond the specifics of this case, i refer the minister to what the then minister, the right hon. and learned member for north east hertfordshire ( sir oliver heald ), said in response to the adjournment debate secured by my hon. friend the member for birmingham, yardley in 2016."", 'the hon. lady is right - others have also called for that. that is why the government are undertaking a review, which has started and which i will come to, in relation to legal aid funding and the legal aid, sentencing and punishment of offenders act 2012 generally, but more particularly and more relevant in this case, in relation to legal aid funding for inquests. i have identified the two circumstances where legal aid was sought and granted in this case. the third, which is what the debate centres on, is the provision of legal aid for judicial review. legal aid is available for judicial review in generic terms. however, as with legal aid for inquests, this availability is subject to a number of restrictions. applicants must satisfy statutory tests for their means and merits in order to qualify for legal aid for judicial review. the reason that they are required to satisfy those tests is to ensure that the resources that are available for legal aid generally are given to those who are most in need. in the case in question, which was an application for funding for a judicial review, the legal aid agency determined that those requirements were not met. i fully appreciate that the families have found that decision of the legal aid agency very frustrating. the hon. member for ashfield ( gloria de piero ) asked whether i can review that decision, but it is important to point out that funding decisions are made by the legal aid agency independently of ministers. i am not privy to the details of the decision. the decision whether to provide legal aid funding in an individual case should not be a political one. it is solely for the director of the legal aid casework at the legal aid agency to decide whether a case is within the regulations and the laws that parliament has set. i was not aware of the reasons why legal aid was determined - that is a decision of the legal aid agency independent of ministers.', 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir christopher. i thank the hon. member for westminster north ( ms buck ) for bringing the debate. i acknowledge her work, as others have done, as chair of the all - party parliamentary group on legal aid. i am delighted to have the opportunity to respond, because legal aid is an important part of our legal system. it is fundamental that individuals have access to justice - the ability to determine their rights in a fair and impartial way - and, as the hon. lady said at the beginning of her speech, legal aid is an important part of the process for those who cannot afford to pay for legal representation. before i address many of the important points made, i want to make three points, which concern the amount of money we have invested and continue to invest in legal aid, the recent steps we have made to expand the scope of legal aid, and the significant investment we are making in our justice system, which will assist all litigants more broadly. first, on spending, it is important to recognise that the government spend a£1. 6 billion a year on legal aid, which is a fifth of the ministry of justice budget. that is in addition to other sources of funding to ensure justice and the fair determination of rights. for example, in the last three years we have spent almost a£6. 5 million in addition through the litigants - in - person support strategy to help people to navigate the legal process. secondly, in recent months the government have increased the scope of legal aid in a number of areas, as the hon. member for hammersmith ( andy slaughter ) kindly highlighted. in january, we broadened the accepted evidence for domestic violence and removed all time limits.']"

in breast cancer awareness month, with a new cancer strategy announced by the prime minister at her recent party conference and while the long - term economic plan for the nhs is being decided. this is an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that the way in which we prevent, diagnose and treat breast cancer, and care for those who have it, truly benefits all patients in every part of the country. every year about 55, 000 people in the uk are diagnosed with breast cancer, making it the most common cancer in the country. one in eight women in the uk will develop breast cancer in their lifetime, and nearly 11, 500 women and 80 men in the uk still lose their lives to breast cancer each year. progress has been made, but survival outcomes vary significantly between regions across the country, and britain continues to trail other european countries on breast cancer survival. as members can imagine, that sort of statistic hits home with me.', 'i, too, thank the hon. member for east kilbride, strathaven and lesmahagow ( dr cameron ) for securing this debate. i would like to take this opportunity to discuss blood cancer in particular. as many will know, there are different types of blood cancer, ranging from leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma to the rarest blood cancers, which affect just a few people. blood cancer is a complex and much misunderstood disease. according to cancer research uk, blood cancer is the third biggest cancer killer in the uk and the fifth most common cancer overall, with more than 230, 000 people living with blood cancer. compared with patients suffering from other cancers, those blood cancer patients had to see their gp significantly more times before being referred to hospital. more than 35 % had to see their gp three or more times before referral, which compares with only 6 % for breast cancer and 23 % for other solid tumour types. according to the office for national statistics, blood cancer is by far the most common cancer among people aged under 30. despite that, a number of issues with blood cancer still need to be addressed. as the hon. member for scunthorpe ( nic dakin ) said, diagnosing can be very complex at times. symptoms such as back pain or tiredness are often misunderstood and diagnosed as other conditions. delays can lead to major problems for patients in terms of not only their quality of life but the overall outcome. recommendations in the cancer strategy for early diagnosis should be reviewed to ensure that all people with blood cancer benefit from early and accurate diagnosis. gps should be encouraged to ask for simple blood tests for people displaying one or more blood cancer symptoms. the cancer strategy says that all cancer patients will have had access to the recovery package by 2020.', 'it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for bosworth ( david tredinnick ), who made an interesting speech. i also thank the hon. member for east kilbride, strathaven and lesmahagow ( dr cameron ) for securing this important debate. we all know someone who has had, or has been affected by, cancer. my family is no exception : both my parents had cancer and my husband lives with cancer every day of his life, and i could talk about cancer forever - but, madam deputy speaker, i will try to limit myself to the recommended time. the cancer strategy sets out strategic priorities and recommendations that aim to improve radically the outcomes that the nhs delivers for people affected by cancer, yet we also know that the specific needs of blood cancer patients are not being fully met by the cancer strategy. that is primarily because the experience of blood cancer patients is different from that of solid tumour cancer patients, so general cancer services are not always effective in meeting their needs. these unmet needs occur in a number of priority areas identified in the cancer strategy, including awareness and early diagnosis, patient experience, living with and beyond cancer, access to new treatments and research, and nhs commissioning. today, i want to focus on one particular issue : the need to improve post stem cell transplant care for blood cancer patients. this issue overlaps with a number of the aforementioned priority areas : patient experience, living with and beyond cancer, and nhs commissioning. it is estimated that by 2020 there will be more than 16, 000 people in the uk living post transplant, many of whom will be experiencing both physical and psychological side - effects from their treatment which can last for months or even years. the side - effects can include graft versus host disease, second cancers, infertility, depression, isolation and post - traumatic stress disorder.']"

it is a war on citizens ' behaviour, and it is most often delivered by the state against the poorest people and communities. we do not put drugs in prisons ; we put people in prisons. we allow the market to regulate itself because we simply prohibit drugs. it is a market, and it will not go away or be managed by simply investing in more police or in border control efforts - it is like trying to make gravity illegal. we cannot be naive and seriously think that there is any way forward but to reform policies to make them fit for today. that brings me to the long - standing issue of the glasgow safer drug consumption facility and heroin - assisted treatment pilot project, which has cross - party support in the city, certainly from labour and the scottish national party. as hon. members might be aware, the issue of drug use and drug - related mortality in glasgow is particularly acute. it is a problem that necessitates radical and disruptive new approaches. almost a third - 267 - of scotland ' s drug - related deaths in 2016 occurred in the greater glasgow and clyde health board area."", ""i, personally, and the government sympathise deeply with the situation faced by alfie dingley and his family. i think that everyone on both sides of the house and outside it will understand and respect the desire of the family to try to alleviate his suffering in any way possible. i assure my hon. friend that we want to help to find a solution within the existing regulations. as my hon. friend will know, the current situation is that cannabis, in its raw form, is not recognised in the uk as having any medicinal benefits. it is therefore listed as a schedule 1 drug under the misuse of drugs regulations 2001. this means that it is unlawful to produce, supply or possess raw cannabis unless it is for the purposes of research. products must be thoroughly tested in the uk to provide the necessary assurances of their efficacy, quality and safety. we have a clear regime in place that is administered by the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency to enable medicines, including those containing controlled drugs such as cannabis, to be developed, licensed and made available for medicinal use to patients in the uk, as happened in the case of sativex, as my hon. friend knows. the home office will consider issuing a licence to enable trials of any new medicine under schedule 1 to the misuse of drugs regulations 2001, providing that it complies with appropriate ethical approvals. cannabis - based products should be treated in the same way as all other drugs, meaning that they should go through the normal testing procedures applied to any other medicines. the current situation is that outside of research we would not issue licences for the personal consumption of cannabis because it is listed as a schedule 1 drug. however, we are aware of differing approaches in other countries and continue to monitor the world health organisation ' s expert committee on drug dependence, which has committed to reviewing the use of medicinal cannabis."", 'i thank the hon. gentleman for his intervention : i agree. ultimately, we all want to see tangible outcomes on the ground in our communities. we can make legislation here and change the classification, but that has to be bought into ; it has to be delivered by local service providers and the police on the ground. my priority, the most important thing for me, is that my constituents in mansfield town centre feel safer as a result. that is exactly what we are after. in the aftermath of that debate in july, 20 police and crime commissioners wrote to the government in support of reclassification, which has received cross - party support and is backed by my local police leaders. nottinghamshire county council and other county councils have written to the government on this issue. spice was originally sold as a legal high, and synthetic cannabinoids were developed as an alternative to cannabis, which leads to a common misconception that these drugs are not hard drugs. it is understandable that they would initially have been made class b drugs. however, the comparison of synthetic cannabinoids to cannabis is entirely inaccurate and their impacts are very different. i cannot emphasise enough that reclassifying these drugs has no connection with cannabis or medical marijuana. in my view, there is a great deal of sense in the medicinal use of cannabis in some cases. i do not argue with that ; indeed, in this debate i do not seek to suggest anything at all about cannabis, frankly. in fact, i want to make the point that the two - cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids - are not comparable and that these psychoactive drugs are not the same thing at all. we need to stop treating cannabis and synthetic cannabis as if they are the same thing, and we need to reclassify synthetic cannabis.']"

the global financial crash had a catastrophic impact on the house building industry in this country. given that much of the credit crunch was down to bad debts, particularly those resulting from bad lending in the us domestic housing market, this was perhaps to be expected. in just two years, the number of homes built crashed by 30 %, and with this the supply of housing just dried up. that economic shock forced the then labour government to drive for affordable house building as part of an economic stimulus programme to help the country through the deep recession. by 2009, the foundations for a new era of affordable house building were laid, with a a£4 billion annual affordable housing programme, backing for councils to receive grant funding and build new council housing, full localisation of council housing finance agreed with the treasury to boost building still further, and a programme of progressively higher standards agreed with industry to make all new build homes zero carbon by 2016. it was a comprehensive programme. since the change of government in 2010, public policy has been perceived as at best indifferent and at worst hostile to affordable housing. one of the first decisions made by conservative ministers after the 2010 election was to cut back new housing investment by more than 60 %. as a result, the number of new government - backed homes for social rent started each year has plummeted from almost 40, 000 to fewer than 1, 000 last year. the number of new low - cost ownership homes being built has halved. the plans that labour left to get councils building 10, 000 homes a year were undermined, dashing any hopes of councils being able to build at scale again.', ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir christopher. it is also a pleasure to bring some gender balance to this debate. i counted 15 men and one woman when we started. i do not know what it is about planning that attracts men more than women, but we need to consider that, because this is such an important subject and it is vital for our communities. why are there not more people here today?

term personal injury get full and fair compensation within a more informed and transparent system in which the rate is set by the lord chancellor at regular intervals with the benefit of independent expert advice. the prospect of the reforms we are proposing both to whiplash claims and to the discount rate has, according to the recent aa british insurance premium index, already triggered a fall in premiums in the expectation that claim costs will fall. i commend the bill to the house.', ""we have a system of small claims -

not included in the scope of this bill - to increase the small claims track limit for road traffic accident personal injury claims to a£5, 000, and for all other personal injury claims to a£2, 000. as these claims are generally not complicated, they are suitable to be managed in the simpler, lower cost small claims track. this route is designed to be accessible to litigants in person without the need for a lawyer, although claimants may still seek legal representation if they wish."", 'it is a pleasure to be able to speak in this debate on the second reading of the civil liability bill, which brings forward changes that are of great importance to the insurance industry. i am pleased to hear that there has been significant engagement between industry and government over this essential legislation. ageas insurance, for example, is one of the largest providers in the uk, employing more than 400 people in my constituency, and it has communicated to me its enthusiastic support for these changes, shared by the vast majority of the public. these measures will help to reduce motor insurance premiums for insurance customers by adjusting how the personal injury discount rate is set. alongside this, the introduction of a new tariff will specifically target exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims that have driven up insurance premiums for hard - working households in places such as stoke - on - trent. a new fixed compensation level for whiplash injury will be created, putting provisions in place for the court to uplift the compensation available in exceptional circumstances, compared with a final compensation figure being negotiated by the parties involved, as is currently the case. the compensation culture that has been created, with huge levels of unjustified claims for things like whiplash, saw premiums rise at the fastest rate ever last year. increases of about 10 % a year are totally unmanageable and unaffordable for motorists. these changes must be brought about to reduce the price all motorists are having to pay to compensate unreasonably high levels of claims. clearly, it is important that these savings are passed on to consumers. i am pleased to hear that the abi, which represents 93 % of the motor insurance market, has written to the lord chancellor emphasising its commitment to this.']"

to - day basis. the overriding purpose of the legislation is to help to shift the balance of power from unscrupulous agents and landlords towards decent tenants - to make renting fairer, more affordable and more transparent and to give tenants greater clarity and control over what they pay. we will all have heard horror stories of agents or landlords charging people excessive fees to secure properties, or throughout tenancies, imposing additional charges with excessively high administration fees. with fewer social properties available, this places great difficulties on those with low incomes, or those who are renting alone or simply cannot afford thousands of pounds in up -

income families. i support the broad aims of this bill, but i would like to draw the government ' s attention to one aspect that continues to leave tenants vulnerable to unfair fees. i have particular concern with schedule 1 ( 4 ), which reserves the right for landlords and letting agents to charge tenants who are forced to default on their tenancy agreements. i believe people who rent through the private sector could be better supported by this part of the bill. i understand that some agents and landlords currently charge a full month ' s rent for tenants to be granted an early release, then every month ' s rent and utilities while a new tenant is found. there are genuine instances where tenants are forced to end tenancy agreements, which they entered into in good faith, through absolutely no fault of their own : for someone living in the private rented sector who is made redundant from their job, benefits might not cover the rent, and any delays in receiving benefits will leave them in rent arrears. someone might have had a family bereavement and might need to move to another part of the country or of the world.""]"

i am sure she thoroughly enjoyed it. the government are committed to tackling and reducing the use of plastics. all manner of efforts are being made, including the 5p charge for plastic bags, which has reduced the number of plastic bags in circulation by around 9 billion - an extraordinary number. there are the government ' s efforts on the blue belt around the overseas territories to try to protect those valuable marine locations from the impact of plastics. closer to home, we know that litter very often ends up in our rivers and seas, and very much of it is plastic, so we have a new national litter strategy for england, which i was delighted to announce as the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs. specifically on the hon. lady ' s point about plastic straws and their use in this place, the administration committee has taken this up. it is committed to reducing the use of single - use plastics, which includes plastic knives and forks as well as straws, and i can tell her that a number of hon. members across this place have committed to a plastic - free lent. i am sure she would be very welcome to join us, should she wish to do so."", ""the reality is that until now, china, turkey, malaysia, indonesia, vietnam and other countries have largely been happy to accept our plastic because they have seen it as a raw material that they can use to generate more products. plastic recycling is technically possible and exists in this country already - it is just that it is not as economical. people have to pay to recycle various sources of plastic rather than getting a benefit from them, although that is changing. we recognise that china has reduced the amount of contamination that it is prepared to accept in plastic - it does not ignore all plastic, but effectively it has closed the market and made it less worth while. i am sure my hon. friend is eagerly awaiting our strategy on resources and waste, which will appear in due course. perhaps more can be revealed at that time. i mentioned the measures in the 25 - year environment plan we published in january, as well as the government ' s commitment to taking action against the problem of single - use plastics waste as part of our wider strategy. we have given a£20 million to the plastics innovation fund, which is co - ordinated by innovate uk and the engineering and physical sciences research council, and which aims to reduce the environmental costs of plastic and litter. i am pleased to say that, in the budget, we announced not only a tax on plastic products that are not at least 30 % recycled, but a further a£20 million of funding : a£10 million extra for r & d and a£10 million to pioneer innovative approaches to boosting recycling and reducing litter. the fund will be made available during the 2019 - 20 financial year. i agree with my hon. friend the member for north cornwall that innovation is vital in supporting developments to tackle plastic waste, so we will continue to explore commercially viable options.""]"

value tariffs. that will help to protect the 11 million households on low standard variable or default tariffs who are not protected by existing caps. as hon. members have said, the difference between the cheapest tariff and the average standard variable tariff from a big six supplier is about a£300 a year, and it has been at about that level for the past six months. that is an awful lot of money for constituents in some of the poorest parts of our region, as well as others in the uk. the competition and markets authority ' s recent investigation into the energy market found that the domestic customers of the big six energy suppliers pay on average a£1. 4 billion a year more than they would in a truly competitive market. i do not think that there is any argument in the house about the fact that the market is not truly competitive. although i believe that promoting competition is generally the most effective way to ensure that customers receive the best value in their service, i welcome the fact that the government are prepared to act when it becomes apparent that markets are not working for consumers. as colleagues have said, the technological advances that will improve the market are not happening fast enough to support vulnerable people now. the government made a manifesto commitment to extend the price protection that is currently in place."", 'quite unsettling, yes. i believe that pressing for an absolute cap over a relative one is the right way to go. as the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee stated, a relative cap could force cheaper energy tariffs to disappear, harming consumers, not protecting them. that would run counter to the sentiment of the bill. as we have heard, ofgem will be given the task of making the cap work effectively with its formula and will be responsible for setting the cap and reviewing it every six months. as outlined by my hon. friend the member for weston - super - mare ( john penrose ), it is beholden on ofgem to get this right and hold people to account, otherwise it will not have been worth while. it is vital that energy companies do not take advantage of any price cap and lift their tariffs to the maximum allowed. as i mentioned earlier, the energy sector needs more price competition to encourage lower prices, and an absolute cap can help to achieve this. i am delighted that the government will require the gas and electricity markets authority to protect consumers beyond the end of the energy price cap. energy companies must not slip back into their old habits as soon as the cap is lifted, putting ordinary people back in the position they were in before the cap and leaving them paying over the odds. the bill will ensure better value for money for many people who, frankly, have been taken for a ride and been paying over the odds for the self same energy that the person down the road has been getting cheaper. as the minister stated, it cannot be fair that between 2012 and 2015 customers paid a£1. 4 billion more than they ought to have done. in 2016, this escalated to an incredible a£2 billion. as i have said before, many of these people fall into the a€œvulnerablea€ category.']"

that this elected chamber never had the opportunity to discuss amendments to a bill that affected the devolution of scotland - thus showing utter contempt for our parliament and for our people. since then the secretary of state has been missing in action, refusing to lead on an emergency debate on the sewel convention that was called by the snp following a refusal to allow time for us to debate clause 15 once the bill had returned from the house of lords."", ""thank you, mr speaker, and if we can help you across the rest of the road, we would be happy to do so. i seek leave to propose that the house should debate a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration -

held practice that the uk government cannot legislate in devolved areas without the consent of the devolved parliament. the first minister of scotland, the scottish government and the scottish parliament have made it clear that the lack of a consent motion would have been fatal to the passage of any changes to the devolution settlement. legislative consent motions are one of the hallmarks of devolution. by proceeding, the uk government have blatantly ignored a central pillar of the relationship between the governments and the parliaments of these islands. this unprecedented move means that the very nature of devolution could be changed forever. what does the failure to grant legislative consent mean if westminster is prepared to ignore the sovereign will of the scottish parliament and the scottish people?"", ""my hon. friend is correct, and that is borne out by my own experiences over the past few days. we have only to look at the increased membership of the scottish national party. there are people coming to the snp who have not supported the snp previously, and who have not supported scottish independence, but who are simply appalled that there is an attack on the scottish parliament and on devolution. i simply say to the secretary of state : by all means, carry on down this road, because the people of scotland will ultimately have to decide where their future lies. what he is doing, as he continues down this road, is helping to strengthen the case for scottish independence. i suppose we should be grateful for that. last week the uk government had a duty to amend the eu ( withdrawal ) bill to respect the will of the scottish parliament, and they failed to do so. although snp mps sought to be constructive with our amendments, we were shut out of the debate while the tories ploughed ahead without any consideration of our proposed solution. the complete contempt for the people of scotland shown by the tory government is sickening. not only were our amendments ignored, the entire debate on devolution was allocated less than 20 minutes of discussion, with no scottish mp allowed to speak up for their constituents. instead, the uk government minister ate up all the time for himself. the scottish tories said that they would come here to stand up for scotland. well, what did they do? they trooped through the lobby to take away scotland ' s powers -

the government clearly recognise the flaws in their argument. when pushed, they claim that voter identification is designed to tackle the perception of electoral fraud. however, new research published today by the electoral reform society shows that mandatory id in polling stations is one of voters ' lowest concerns - just 4 % of voters believe id is the most important priority for our democracy. the top issues for voters were : ensuring that elections are free from the influence of large financial donations, an accurate voting register and balanced media coverage."", ""the british public deserve to have confidence in our democracy. there is clearly the potential for electoral fraud in our system and that undermines confidence and promotes perceptions of vulnerability. when fraud is committed in elections, it is not a victimless crime ; people ' s votes are stolen or someone is elected who should not have been elected. earlier this year, the government announced that they would be conducting pilots for voter identification at the local elections in may this year in line with our manifesto commitment to legislate to ensure that a form of id must be presented before voting. voter id is part of the government ' s commitment to improve the security and the resilience of the electoral system that underpins our democracy and will promote greater confidence in our democratic processes. in making these changes, we will bring our electoral system in line with others such as that in northern ireland or canada, which operate successful programmes, and recognise that there is an increasing expectation that someone ' s vote should be protected and carefully guarded. we already ask that people prove who they are in order to claim benefits, to rent a car or even to collect a parcel from the post office, so this is a proportionate and reasonable approach. democracy is precious and it is right to take that more robust approach to protect the integrity of the electoral process. the independent electoral commission has, since 2014, pushed for the introduction of id to strengthen the system, and it has welcomed the voter id pilots as a positive first step towards implementing its own recommendation that an accessible, proportionate voter identification scheme should be introduced in great britain. in a recent report for democratic audit uk, academic stuart wilks - heeg stated that, after the scheme was introduced in northern ireland, there was no evidence to suggest a fall in turnout, but that there was plenty of evidence that fraud declined sharply.""]"

how will a university know when it is dealing with the regulator, a funding council or the voice of government? it is that final point that will be concerning to many universities and students, who worry that, far from acting as a voice for students to the government - i ask as the minister chunters away - the office for students will be the opposite : the government demanding a voice on to students. for instance, the minister wants the office for students to stop no - platform policies that ban hate groups from student unions. this seems to be a solution in search of a problem. perhaps he can explain why he believes that he and the board of the office for students should use their resources to interfere at this level.', ""with permission, mr speaker, i would like to make a statement on the review of post - 18 education and funding. while i am not announcing new policy today, i welcome the opportunity to confirm to the house details of a major review across post - 18 education and funding, as announced by the prime minister yesterday. before i discuss the specifics of the review, i should highlight some of the strengths and successes of our existing post - 18 system. we have a world - class higher education system. sixteen british universities are in the world ' s top 100 and four are in the top 10. we have record numbers of young people entering university, including from disadvantaged backgrounds. our student finance system removes up - front financial barriers and provides protections for borrowers so that they only have to contribute when they can afford to do so. a university degree provides significant financial returns to the individual : graduates on average benefit from their university education by over a£100, 000 over their lifetime. the higher education and research act 2017 sets the foundation for further improvements, with the office for students a strong voice for students and to ensure minimum standards. the director for fair access and participation will help to drive social mobility. the teaching outcomes and excellence framework measures are in the legislation as well, as is the facilitation of further diversity with new providers and shorter degrees delivered at a lower cost to students. the technical and further education act 2017 extends the responsibilities of the institute for apprenticeships to include technical education, as well as introducing degree - level apprenticeships. new institutes of technology will be established, which will focus on higher - level technical skills and will be eligible for access to loans and grants for their students. t - levels are in development - a true, equal - standing alternative to a - levels. we will build on those important reforms in this review."", ""i agree absolutely with the hon. gentleman. indeed, that contrasts sharply with what universities uk has said in response to the education committee : a€œunconditional offers account for a very small proportion of all offers made by universities. it is simply not in the interests of universities to take students without the potential to succeed at university. a€there has clearly been a huge growth in the number of unconditional offers, for some of the reasons that the hon. gentleman has just mentioned. schools have expressed concerns about students across the spectrum of abilities not performing to their full potential in exams, because they are safe in the knowledge that they have already secured a place at university regardless of their grades. although that can be a welcome safety net for some students, we must balance it with the impacts that it can have on schools and how it affects their exam results overall, for which they are held accountable and against which, of course, they have their own performance measured. this is not a new problem but it has now spread far more widely, as i said earlier. in my constituency, anecdotal evidence has been cited of students giving up college courses after receiving an unconditional offer, which of course may result in their struggling at university if they have missed fundamental information that they would otherwise have been taught. if we let this development go unchecked, we are letting our young people down at a time when we should be supporting them in preparing for their next step in education. of course all universities should be able to make unconditional offers, but in doing so they should surely exercise a duty of care to the interests of the prospective student at the same time. i look forward to hearing the minister ' s views in a moment on what is a complex matter.""]"

how is it that the government still do not know how many private tower blocks are unsafe? how is it that only seven out of more than 300 tower blocks across the country with the same grenfell - style cladding have had it removed and replaced? how can it be that ministers offered money to councils and housing association landlords for re - cladding costs and finally agreed to consult on a combustible cladding ban only last week? many people will have learned only yesterday that the london fire service has fundamentally changed its safety advice to residents in blocks still wrapped with the same grenfell - style cladding. in place of a€œstay puta€ if a fire breaks out - strong advice given for decades to all residents in all tower blocks across the country, including those in grenfell tower - the london fire brigade now says a€œget outa€ directly. do all fire brigades now give the same advice? do all residents in all blocks with unsafe cladding know that? i say to the minister that more action, more clarity and more urgency are required from the government. when will the secretary of state publish a clear national statement on evacuation policy? when will he confirm when all tower blocks be re - clad?', 'i thank the secretary of state for the advance copy of his statement this morning. i join him in thanking dame judith hackitt and her team for all the work that they have done on this review. this is, as she says, a complex and confusing area. our building safety system catastrophically failed the residents of grenfell tower and has proved to be comprehensively flawed when over 300 other tower blocks around the country are wrapped in the same dangerous, unsafe cladding. dame judith said this morning : a€œthis is a broken system and it needs to be fixed. a€but while there are some welcome reforms in her report, it will not do that. why no ban on combustible cladding and insulation? it really beggars belief that the report continues to give a green light to combustible materials on high - rise blocks. i say to the secretary of state : do not consult on it - do it. seventy - two people died in grenfell tower. australia had a high - rise fire in 2014 ; it now has a ban. dubai had a high - rise fire in 2015 ; it has a ban. we must do the same. we owe it to the grenfell residents and we owe it to residents living today in other tower blocks with the same grenfell - style cladding. the secretary of state was here yesterday when mps on both sides of the house argued for this. even dame judith hackitt was reported this morning as saying that she would support the secretary of state if he did this just after ruling it out, of course, in her own report. there are some steps that dame judith recommends that are welcome and that would help, such as clearer duties on those responsible for building safety and new ways for residents to have their concerns heard and acted on.']"

corruption plan. i was delighted to play a role as a minister in the introduction of measures on beneficial ownership and the public register in this country through the small business, enterprise and employment act 2015. there was also an anti - corruption summit in 2016. however, there has been delay since then. at that time, the government committed themselves to legislate to increase transparency in the housing market and to require overseas companies that owned property to declare their beneficial ownership publicly. that was supposed to be in place by april, but now it, too, has been delayed. we will not see even a draft bill until the summer, and we will not get the actual legislation until next year. the issue of the overseas territories really matters. more than three quarters of corruption cases involving property that were investigated by the met ' s proceeds of corruption unit involved anonymous companies based in secrecy jurisdictions, and nearly four fifths of those were registered in either the overseas territories or the crown dependencies. as i have said, it is important that we get our house in order."", ""as most hon. members have stated in this debate, money laundering and corruption are huge issues worldwide. although i welcome some of the measures in the bill, i do not believe that it goes far enough. the minister for europe and the americas has already been made aware - it was mentioned in an intervention - that, as part of the recently agreed fifth eu anti - money laundering directive, all eu member states will be required to have public beneficial ownership registers by 2019. i am sure he will confirm that, whether or not the united kingdom is part of the eu at the time of the directive ' s implementation, the united kingdom would not want any measures that are weaker than those in the directive. this raises the question of what should happen in the overseas territories. the uk has made a start on a public beneficial ownership register, but more needs to be done in the overseas territories. as my right hon. friend the member for barking ( dame margaret hodge ) pointed out, the problem is that many overseas territories are tax havens and as such they are home to many offshore companies willing to offer complete anonymity to their clientele, with very few questions asked. we should note that, despite overseas territories having small populations, half of all global trade passes through them because they are tax havens, and the vast majority of the transactions are carried out by offshore companies. let us, for example, take the british virgin islands. despite having a population of only 28, 000, it is home to an estimated 500, 000 offshore companies, which is 40 % of the total number of offshore companies in the world. many of these offshore companies have complete anonymity and are shell companies working with nominees and powers of attorney to move around vast amounts of money. most people faced with that information would conclude that there is something dodgy going on. my right hon."", ""it is early days, but i think the existing powers are being used rather less than my hon. friend and i would wish, and i have read out a list of people who are sanctioned by other countries, but not sanctioned by the uk. that was my second point. my final point relates to the much discussed issue of open registers and the overseas territories. the house will recall the actions of the coalition government and britain ' s leadership at the g8 in tackling tax evasion and tax havens. i thought the hon. member for bishop auckland was a touch too curmudgeonly in acknowledging the extent to which the coalition government made real progress on those matters. the uk has introduced publicly accessible registers of people with significant control, abolished bearer or anonymous shares and introduced unexplained wealth orders, while the anti - bribery law was finally introduced by the coalition government. britain has a proud record of world leadership on this under a conservative - led government. this is the fourth occasion on which i, along with my right hon. and hon. friends - under the able, cross - party leadership of the right hon. member for barking ( dame margaret hodge ) - have tried to coax the government into visiting on the overseas territories the same level of openness and transparency as we have in this country. let us be clear on the constitutional position, which the government set out in 2012 : a€œas a matter of constitutional law the uk parliament has unlimited power to legislate for the territories. a€the overseas territories themselves recognise that they gain hugely from their relationship with the united kingdom. the overseas territories have been resistant to this argument for three reasons. the first -

i expect the minister will say, a€œwe have introduced new routes to expand the number of nursing staff. a€ there are nursing degree apprenticeships that few people are taking up, because employers do not have enough cash to release people to study. nursing associates, who were introduced in a supporting role to the registered nurse, should never be a substitute for registered nurses. these efforts have been small and unpredictable. most importantly, they have not addressed the heart of what grows the number of nurses safely and at scale : higher education. this is workforce panicking, not workforce planning. i expect the minister will say, a€œthis government have grown the number of nurses working in hospitals, a€ which is factually true, but distorts the truth that the overall number of nurses has only grown by less than 1 % since 2010. while there are 7 % more nurses in acute settings, there are 6, 500 fewer nurses in the community, 43 % fewer district nurses, a quarter fewer school nurses, nearly 5, 000 fewer mental health nurses and 40 % fewer learning disability nurses.', ""last month my mum celebrated her 95th birthday. like many irish nurses of her age, 75 years ago she travelled to london from ireland to start her career in the very first generation of nhs nurses by qualifying as a state enrolled nurse at warlingham park psychiatric hospital. growing up, i saw at first hand just how vital a dedicated, passionate and happy nurse was for the welfare of the patients. that is why i am incensed when i see the treatment of trainee nurses today. let us be clear. nursing students are exceptional. their courses are complex, their training is tough, and they spend significant amounts of time on clinical placement, working all hours of the day and night. they deserve a tuition and living cost funding model that recognises their extraordinary efforts and the importance of those efforts. england is now the only country in the uk without some form of bursary for the nursing degree. that has crumbled the number of nursing applications and fostered an environment that is utterly unfair to nursing students and completely unsafe for patients. the government promised that reforms would provide up to 10, 000 additional nursing and health professional training places but, since the loss of the bursary, nursing applications in england are down by a third and falling fast. in fact, the 2018 figure was the lowest since nursing courses were first included in the ucas system. nursing must be made an attractive profession for all groups, and restoring the bursary is a fundamental step to achieving that. now is not the time to experiment with funding models for nursing students. one in three nurses is due to retire within the decade. ensuring the long - term recruitment of new nurses must be a government priority. that, of course, is before we take account of the brexit impact : 75 % of nhs trusts have done nothing to prepare for the uk ' s departure from the eu.""]"

it is a fallacy to believe that people who profess to be anti - racist cannot be anti - semitic, and that anti - semitism is confined to the right wing of politics. the notion of conspiratorial, powerful jews - or zionists - controlling international capital and manipulating the media for their own ends is to be found on the left as well. it is all too evident in the labour party ' s current problem with anti - semitism. the small british jewish community - less than 0. 5 % of the population - is increasingly disturbed by the growth and normalisation of anti - semitism."", ""i will not give way to the hon. lady because i have given way twice already and i do not want to take up too much time. i am glad that we will have our own holocaust museum alongside the palace of westminster, and i look forward to that being developed so that we can bring young people here to see the importance of that element of society. there are also actions that we can all take. i was proud to sponsor early - day motion 743 for holocaust memorial day, and i believe that 55 right hon. and hon. members have signed it so far. the book of commitment will be available for members to sign each day next week between 2pm and 4pm close to the members ' cloakroom, and i commend that to all members. we also have the challenge of combating anti - semitism on university campuses. one current challenge is that many jewish children go to jewish schools and are not exposed to anti - semitism until they get to university. in my view, we are not preparing our young people sufficiently for what they may face, and i am delighted that the government are taking action to combat anti - semitism on university campuses by sponsoring visits for sabbatical officers to go to auschwitz - birkenau and to see at first hand what can happen if matters get out of hand. as we have said, the holocaust started with words and other forms of anti - semitism, and expanded to what we have seen in the death camps. we must commend all those who speak out against anti - semitism, from whichever political party. i was proud recently to share a platform with hon. friends on the opposition benches at my local synagogue, stanmore synagogue, for a question and answer session, during which i commended them for their bravery in standing up and calling out anti - semitism in their own party.""]"

the services that children in need relied on - have fallen prey to the government ' s austerity programme and are disappearing. in that environment, in any organisation, the roles and responsibilities that have the weight of legislation behind them - the things that absolutely must be done - are always the ones that take prominence. there is no legal requirement for local authorities to continue to support children in need when they turn 18, so it should come as no surprise that those children, on the cusp of adulthood, fall into the abyss. looking at the current figures for 16 and 17 - year - olds classed as children in need, that means that approximately 58, 000 children are being cast adrift.""]"

there can be only two answers to that question : either the bank is entirely incompetent ; or those running it have not been honest. i am calling today on the lloyds chair and the board to publish that report in its entirety. following the conviction of the six hbos individuals who are now serving a combined prison sentence of 48 years, why has there been such a failure by lloyds to compensate its victims?', ""i am conscious of time, madam deputy speaker. i am disappointed that we are having to debate this matter at all today, let alone for the second time this year. the section 166 report highlighted that rbs grg was focused on profit over customer service. i was also interested to note that the tomlinson report found few examples of businesses entering the rbs grg then being returned to local management. on a separate, but related, point, in my own dealings with rbs over its closure of three branches in my constituency, it has been clear that customer service is not the bank ' s priority. i want to touch briefly on how the actions of rbs grg have impacted upon my constituents. one constituent, who has been in regular contact, is appalled by the conduct of rbs grg. he ran his own property development business in my constituency and was in the hands of grg for a number of years. he was so aggrieved by its actions that he produced a 19 - page report describing in tragic detail the manner in which rbs denied him the opportunity to rebuild the company after it fell into problems, closed down the company, which he had built from scratch, and tried to evict his entire family from the family home. this is but one example. i know that other members have many more. small and medium - sized businesses are the backbone of our economy and often the lifeblood of our communities. they employ our constituents and pay the taxes that fund our public services - taxes that were also used to bail out the banks, including rbs. it is bad enough we had to bail them out in the first place ; for those banks then actively to undermine the very source of their rescue is a serious moral, as well as legal, issue that we are right to consider and which we must address."", ""it has been a sobering experience to listen to this debate. we have heard so many stories and so much advocacy from hon. members on behalf of constituents. i commend everyone who has spoken today. i thank my hon. friend the member for east lothian ( martin whitfield ) and the all - party parliamentary group on fair business banking for securing this debate on a topic that continues to be of such critical importance. in my remarks i want to : restate the opposition ' s support for a full public inquiry ; talk a little about the current inadequacy of the regulator and the section 166 procedure ; state why an independent mechanism of redress for business is clearly required ; and say why this is in the best interests not just of customers and the country, but of the banks themselves. this debate shows that the issues around the relationship between banks and their business customers are not fading, diminishing or going away. rather, in recent weeks we have continued to hear yet more appalling revelations about the way in which rbs ' s global restructuring group treated its customers and stories of how that had spread to other financial institutions too. following the efforts of my hon. friend the member for norwich south ( clive lewis ), we can now read the full section 166 report on the conduct of the grg unit. the extent of the inexcusable behaviour revealed in that report is truly shocking. the purchase of the assets of distressed businesses, in some cases by rbs staff themselves, illustrates just how deeply the conflicts ran within grg. clearly, certain bank employees felt that they could act with total impunity towards their customers, and that cannot be acceptable. we are all aware that the complaints process is ongoing between rbs and its former business customers who were the victims of grg. however, i echo the call made by my hon.""]"

there was a riot at bedford in november 2016. what have the government done since to improve the situation, bearing in mind what the chief inspector of prisons has said? whose fault is it that in the latest annual performance figures, hmp bedford is still labelled as a prison of serious concern? it remains one of the most overcrowded prisons in the country - 40 % over capacity. what has the minister done, and what have the government done, to tackle overcrowding there since the 2016 riot? more widely, what plans do the government have to end overcrowding across the prison estate, given that over half of prisons are overcrowded?"", 'essentially, the hon. gentleman posed three questions. the first is whether we recognised the problems in bedford following the 2016 riot. we certainly did. the riot in 2016 was very disturbing, and since then we put the prison into special measures. so we absolutely agree with the criticisms made by the hon. member for bedford ( mohammad yasin ), and by the shadow secretary of state, and indeed by the inspector. that is why we put bedford prison into special measures ; that is why we anticipated this inspection report. the second question was, how many of these urgent notifications are coming? fundamentally, as i laid out at the beginning of my speech, this is a problem that exists in many of our local prisons. it is not an issue that specifically exists in cat d prisons, or in the high security estate, or particularly in the female estate. this is an issue in prisons such as bedford, exeter, nottingham and liverpool, and, as we discovered, birmingham. what is the solution? the shadow secretary of state asks whether the question is a private / public question. it is not an ideological question. two of the best local prisons currently in the country, forest bank and thameside, are private prisons. bedford is, of course, a public prison. he asked whether we would look at the ratio between prison officers and prisoners, and rightly pointed out that in birmingham, as in other prisons, when we face these kinds of problems, often we temporarily reduce prisoner numbers and bring in additional prison officers. i can undertake that that is something we will be examining during the 28 days we have ; we will prepare a plan and come forward with an answer for the chief inspector. it is a very reasonable proposal, and it is one we will consider very carefully.']"

it is a question of how to make it safe and as enjoyable as possible. the rules are out - of - date and we need our government to act. it is clear from the turnout how many mps this campaign has reached. i was pleased to host an event on this important issue for the football supporters federation, safety experts and parliamentary colleagues before today ' s debate. safe standing is an issue whose time has come, a fact borne out by the simple numbers. it is borne out by its successful use outside the top two flights week in, week out. it is borne out by the 94 % of fans surveyed by the efl, who made it clear that they wanted a choice in the type of match day experience they had. it is also borne out by the more than 100, 000 football fans and supporters who signed the petition to secure today ' s debate. fans want safe standing even if they do not want it for themselves, and it is increasingly clear that clubs want safe standing, too. i was delighted that earlier this month my hon. friend the member for tooting ( dr allin - khan ) announced that the labour party backs safe standing. i salute her leadership on the issue."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr robertson. i shall try to make some comments while ignoring the taunting of the portsmouth fan on the opposition benches to my right - although it is difficult to ignore. if we want to see who is successful in football, we need only note that southampton has survived in the premier league again this year, while pompey languishes somewhere closer to the sunday leagues. all - seater stadiums have been required by law since 1994. there were good reasons for introducing them, but i think that now is the time to consider whether we can have safe standing as well as seating. safe standing has been trialled and is now accepted as being safe. in 2011 the scottish premier league relaxed its requirement for all - seater stadiums and celtic, as has been mentioned, now has a safe standing space for 3, 000 supporters. next season, league one team shrewsbury town will join celtic and have its own safe standing area. the stunning st mary ' s stadium in southampton has a capacity of more than 32, 000. frequently 32, 000 fans attend to watch - unlike at portsmouth, not far down the road. the saints moved from the iconic dell ground in 2000. we used to stand on the terraces until the move to the new stadium. many football fans want to continue to stand, and southampton fans are no exception. fans in the northam stand all too often still stand, although by law they should not. that presents the club with a difficult decision about how to police the situation ; thus far it has not managed to do it. however, the situation proves that safe standing, even in an environment where there is standing between seats, has been safe for some 18 years at southampton football club."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr robertson. i want to thank the chair of the pompey supporters trust, simon colebrook, for talking with me about the issue, as well as our excellent shadow minister, my hon. friend the member for tooting ( dr allin - khan ), who has led our party in backing safe standing across the football league. i thank, also, the owner of portsmouth football club, who has written to me about this important issue today. in a debate about safe standing in championship and premier league games, pompey fans will be painfully aware that, despite a prolific history of european and top division football, not to mention multiple fa cup wins, our club are currently enjoying a short break from the pressures of the premier league. nevertheless, our time in this country ' s top two divisions means that, under current legislation, we are required permanently to remain all - seater. our club is therefore a prime example of the injustice of the government ' s stance on safe standing, because in reality the issue is not whether to bring safe standing into football grounds ; it is already there. when portsmouth fans travel to the grounds of bristol rovers, peterborough united, wycombe wanderers and countless other sides in the football league, they see stadiums where fully licensed standing sections are operated. yet back at fratton park they have no choice : standing sections are not allowed. that is all because we previously spent more than three seasons in the top two tiers. i must admit that i am puzzled about why the government think standing becomes safer as the quality of football gets worse. if that is true, southampton fans should not be made to sit. why should divisional status - and historical divisional status, at that - have implications for whether clubs can have standing sections at their grounds?""]"

up of civil partnership and marriage among same - sex couples. since 2013, when marriage was introduced for same - sex couples, an increasing number of couples have chosen marriage instead of civil partnerships. we do not know, however, whether the current levels of demand will be sustained or whether they will change over time. we currently have only two full years of data for civil partnership formation following the introduction of marriage for same - sex couples. given the scale and significance of the decision, it is proportionate to gather more data so that we can be sure that demand has stabilised. our assessment is that we will have a proportionate amount of evidence by september 2019 to be confident in assessing the ongoing level of demand for civil partnerships among same - sex couples. the second piece of work that we are committing to undertake relates to those already in civil partnerships. we continue to consider whether phasing out civil partnerships for same - sex couples is the best way forward. we want to approach the issue sensitively and delicately because it would be wrong to rush towards a decision without understanding how it would affect same - sex couples who continue to opt for a civil partnership and who do not wish to convert their civil partnership into a marriage. we are therefore committing to undertake research with same - sex couples to understand their motivations for forming and remaining in a civil partnership, and what they may do if the evidence drives us to remove them.', ""i congratulate the hon. member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ) on introducing such an important bill. i am proud that the landmark policy of civil partnerships was introduced by labour. we took a stand long before it was considered fashionable or acceptable. we took a stand to allow lesbian, gay and bisexual people to have their relationships recognised by law and to have benefits equal to those for married couples. that proud moment built on labour ' s history of fighting for the equal rights of lgbtq + people, and the civil partnership act 2004 paved the way for same sex marriage. following the passing of same sex - marriage legislation, it is a complete anomaly and unjustice that civil partnerships are not available to all, an anomaly that the government could have easily rectified and would have received support from both sides of the house to do so. although i was not a member at the time, it is clear that the only reason labour did not push further to extend civil partnerships during the passage of the marriage ( same sex couples ) act 2013 was for fear of losing it altogether. we were met with much hostility when we introduced civil partnerships, but we were on a mission to ensure some level of equality as quickly as possible, and we achieved just that. times have now moved on, but it appears that some attitudes have not. allowing some couples to choose whether to marry or to enter a civil partnership while others cannot is no equality at all. that anomaly is not in the spirit of either the civil partnership act or the marriage ( same sex couples ) act, which are based firmly in parity and not in the semantics that are often used to hide bigotry and prejudice. labour members believe that all people should be equal before the law."", ""i echo the support that has been expressed for the bill, which will ensure the registration of stillbirths before 24 weeks and give coroners the power to investigate stillbirths. i will concentrate on the clauses that address civil partnerships. i stress that i understand the case that hon. members have made today, and i applaud the passion of my hon. friend the member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ) for this topic. although i welcome a report and a review to find more evidence, i think that rolling out civil partnerships to everyone is not the right approach, as i am confident such a review would highlight. it is time to refresh our minds as to why civil partnerships were invented. they were invented because same - sex marriage was not legal. civil partnerships were not intended to be a permanent alternative to marriage. they were created to allow same - sex couples access to rights, responsibilities and protections equivalent to those afforded to married couples. that is no longer the case. i appreciate and empathise with the argument that the current situation is unequal because opposite - sex civil partnerships are not available, but the answer is not necessarily to expand civil partnerships. in fact, i would rather see civil partnerships cease altogether. today everyone in the uk can get married. we finally have equality, which is what people have campaigned for and fought for. expanding civil partnerships to all would serve to add an extra tier, which would confuse and complicate commitment, rather than encouraging it. let us also be clear that there is no legal difference between marriage and civil partnership. the differences are in the names, in the ceremonies and the fact that women are, of course, named on their children ' s civil partnership certificates, but we can address that separately - i passionately believe in naming women on their children ' s marriage certificates.""]"

the issue is simple : it comes down to the integrity of the word of a member of her majesty ' s government, the government chief whip. you will recall, mr speaker, that a former prime minister, margaret thatcher, demanded a rerun of a vote - and got it - from a labour government. the answers in the statements made by the prime minister and the leader of the house on 18 july confirmed that the government chief whip was less than candid with his fellow ministers, including the prime minister, by not declaring that he actively instructed conservative mps to break pairing arrangements. it is clear that the prime minister and the leader of the house have unwittingly misled the house by characterising the government chief whip ' s action as an a€œhonest mistakea€. this is a serious breach of the ministerial code. does the minister for the cabinet office believe that the government chief whip ' s integrity is above reproach?

the appointment of the first victims ' commissioner to champion the interests of victims and witnesses in 2010 ; and the publication of a€œgetting it right for victims and witnessesa€ in 2012, which set out the government ' s approach to ensuring that victims and witnesses get the support they need. the victims strategy consolidates and builds on that progress but recognises that more still needs to be done. i thank and pay tribute to all the victims, victims ' groups and experts who have willingly shared their experiences and sat on the victims panel, and to my predecessor, my hon. friend the member for bracknell ( dr lee ), who initiated this work."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mrs main. it has been a pleasure to hear all the contributions this afternoon, especially that of my hon. friend the member for telford ( lucy allan ). i hope i can go some way to answer all the questions, including the battery of questions that the shadow minister just posed. if i do not answer the questions appropriately, hon. members will get correspondence following the debate. i thank the hon. member for leeds north west ( alex sobel ) for securing this debate on the rights of victims of crime. it is particularly timely given the recent focus on such matters in a number of high - profile cases. i know through my own personal experience of meeting victims of crime, speaking with support organisations and meeting many of the hon. members present, exactly how important such rights are in the lives of victims. i am therefore grateful for the opportunity to discuss them with you today. victims ' rights are now a fundamental part of our justice system, and ensuring that victims receive the rights they are entitled to is a priority for this government. that is essential if we are to enable victims to cope with and recover from crime. we must also continue to drive improvement in the broader experience of victims, which involves ensuring that criminal justice agencies provide victims with a service appropriate to their needs and respectful of them as individuals. that also requires focus on the wider performance of agencies. victims want cases to be well managed and dealt with swiftly. beyond the criminal justice agencies, it is important that victim support services are in a position to offer victims the sorts of support they may need to aid their long - term recovery. turning to the current framework of victims ' rights, we look first to the statutory victims code, which does two fundamentally important things. first, it sets out for victims exactly what they are entitled to receive from the criminal justice system.""]"

we take them away from their environment and put them somewhere separate, where they generally respond much better. if people have committed crimes, they should have that impingement placed on them. the use of that technology should be denied them. i think that the purpose of the bill - i did not serve on the public bill committee, so i stand to be corrected on this - is to strengthen safety and security in prisons, through the authorisation of interference of public communications. in 2016 the government published plans for reforming the prison system, including the measures in the bill. the a€œprison safety and reforma€ white paper set out the government ' s plans to deliver a mix of operational changes and to underpin the legal changes required. our prisons face significant security challenges. in 2016, approximately 13, 000 mobile phones and 7, 000 sim cards were found in prisons - an incredible number. that was an increase of 7, 000 mobile phones from 2013."", 'the hon. lady is quite right, and i will go on to explain how mobile phones are used to continue crime in our prison service. to reiterate, last year 23, 656 mobile phones were found in our prisons, which is nearly 65 a day. in my constituency, 184 mobile phones and 80 sim cards were found at hmp lewes last year, and having visited the prison regularly and met prison officers and the governor, i have heard at first hand the implications of that. as the hon. lady pointed out, illegal mobile phones present a serious risk to the security of our prisons, as well as to public safety. mobile phones in prisons are used for a range of criminal purposes, including commissioning serious violence, harassing victims, and continuing involvement in extremist activity and organised crime. access to mobile phones is strongly associated with drug supplies and violence in our prisons, so it is a serious problem. it might be argued that the prison service should be better at stopping mobiles entering our prisons in the first place, but as the previous justice secretary made clear in a speech to reform in december last year, technological advances have been harnessed by some manufacturers with the clear intention of circumventing prison security measures. technological advances have made it possible to manufacture phones so small, and containing so little metal, that they can be concealed internally and are difficult to detect with existing screening machines. phones have been marketed as a€œbeat the bossa€, which refers to the body orifice security scanner that is in use in our prison receptions. however, just as technology can be harnessed for illicit ends, we can also enlist its support to improve the effectiveness of our response to the problem. public communications providers such as mobile phone operators have been at the forefront of rapid technological developments in mobile communications.', ""this welcome bill goes some way to addressing the issues surrounding mobile phones in prison, and as my hon. friend the member for west ham ( lyn brown ) said, evidence has shown time and again that mobile phones have been smuggled into prison for use by inmates, often to enable them to engage in further illegal activity. they are used illicitly to order drugs, harass victims, and organise crime, both inside and outside the prison. the use of phones for such activities is completely unacceptable, but figures indicate that the number of phones conveyed into prisons for use by inmates is increasing. the hon. member for lewes ( maria caulfield ) gave some figures, and i shall present some others that show a similar trend. in 2013, there were around 7, 500 reported incidences of mobile phones and sim cards being found in prison, but by 2015 that figure had increased to nearly 17, 000. mobile phone use in prisons is a problem that needs tackling, and the bill is a welcome step forward. i might question whether back benchers should be driving forward legislation to tackle illegal prison activity, rather than the government, but nevertheless the ability to interfere with wireless telegraphy and to disrupt mobile phone use in a designated, specified area could have a significant impact in reducing the use of mobile phones and, subsequently, any further illegal activity through their use. although the bill goes some way to addressing organised violence and drugs in prisons, it cannot be seen as a panacea to end the problems in our prisons. violence, drugs, and further crime are not helped by the government ' s treatment of our prisons system, which has produced an environment that allows them to flourish. the government ' s decision to slash prison budgets, axe prison officers and neglect our prisons has led to overcrowding and violence.""]"

building of the andsf.', ""with permission, mr speaker, i will make a statement on afghanistan. the united kingdom will never forget the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks and the thousands of innocent women, men and children killed in the atrocity. that barbaric violence prompted the uk, alongside our nato allies, to enter afghanistan to ensure that terrorists could not use it as a base from which to attack our citizens at home or abroad. before i continue, i want to pay tribute to the efforts of the tens of thousands of brave british men and women who have served in afghanistan for the past 16 years. we will never forget what they did, particularly those 456 brave men and women who paid the ultimate price and those who suffered life - changing injuries in the line of duty. their service and sacrifice has not been in vain. as i saw when i visited back in march, not only do millions of ordinary afghans now have access to clean water, vital medicine and education, which would not have seemed possible less than 20 years ago, not only have they enabled the afghan people to take charge of their own security, and not only is the capability of the afghan national defence and security forces growing, but elections are giving a voice to the people of afghanistan, who are increasingly calling for peace, which would have been unthinkable a short time ago. our commitment to afghanistan remains an enduring one. although uk combat operations ended in 2014, our troops are playing a key role in nato ' s resolute support mission by leading the kabul security force. they are performing a vital role in training, advising and assisting the afghan national army and air force and developing the nationwide security structures that will strengthen afghanistan ' s democracy. they have a quick reaction force that works alongside the afghan army to provide urgent help in kabul if and when required."", 'the hon. lady raises a very serious issue. the terrorist attack that she refers to was indeed appalling. as she said, too many victims lost their lives as a result of that attack that took place in afghanistan. it is important that we ensure that we are providing support, as we do through our contribution in afghanistan. that is a contribution to security in the kabul area specifically from our forces, but it is also about working with others to ensure that the afghan security forces are able to provide security and safety for all communities living in afghanistan. tremendous achievements have been made in afghanistan today, compared with the situation before these efforts, but sadly, as the hon. lady highlights, too many terrorist attacks are still taking place in afghanistan. we will continue to work with our allies and the afghan government to prevent these in future and to ensure that people can go about their daily lives in safety and security and with confidence.']"

we are talking about a genuinely life - or - death issue. it is a true tragedy that 456 adults and 14 children lost their lives last year while on the organ donation list. every single day, somebody dies because they do not get the transplant that they desperately need. there are around 6, 500 people waiting for organs who do not want to become a part of those statistics. this legislation is for them, and it is about saving lives. organ donation does save lives : around 50, 000 people in the uk are alive today because they have had an organ transplant. some 80 % of the population support organ transplants in principle and 25 million people are on the nhs organ donors list - including, i am proud to say, me. that number has risen by 75 % over the past 10 years, and transplants are up 56 %. the bill, as i am sure its author will agree, is about removing obstructions to donating while at the same time allowing anyone who does not wish to donate to opt out. as many colleagues have said, it is important that we do not attach any stigma to anybody who chooses to opt out for a variety of perfectly valid reasons.', 'absolutely. i think that schools are an ideal forum for a number of public health awareness messages on a host of issues to be delivered to young people. perhaps the solution to all these concerns has been developed in the two countries where the opt - out system is working well, wales and spain. in wales, the system came into force in 2015. the law sets out that those who live and die there will be deemed to have given consent for their organs to be used unless they have explicitly said otherwise. before that change in the law came into effect, a public awareness campaign alone resulted in an increase in the number of organs transplanted from 120 to 160. that was not huge, but it was a definite start. nhs organ donation statistics show an 11. 8 % increase between 2014 - 15 and 2016 - 17 in the number of people in wales opting to donate their organs. that was the highest increase among england, wales and scotland. although there has not been a notable change since the law came into effect, it is worth remembering that - as we heard earlier - spain took almost 10 years to increase organ donation rates significantly. spain has had a soft opt - out system for 39 years. it is considered to be the world leader in organ donation and currently has the highest organ donation rates in the world. in spain, consent is presumed in the absence of any known objection by the deceased, but family consent is still sought, as it would be here, we hope. in the immediate aftermath of this change in law, there was only a small increase in the number of organ donations and transplants, but there was a dramatic increase after 1989, when the spanish government made a big push to reorganise organ donation, as a result of which there was a medically trained transplant co - ordinator in every hospital by 1999.', ""i thank my hon. friend the member for coventry north west ( mr robinson ) for introducing this important private member ' s bill. the nhs has just reached the historic milestone of 70 years. as a country and as a society, we are proud of the landmark advances we have made within that time. because of advances in organ donation and transplantation, 50, 000 people are alive today. most people are willing to donate their organs after they die, but only 36 % of the population are on the organ donation register. organ donation is increasing gradually, but sadly it is not keeping pace with the number of people on the transplant waiting list. the british heart foundation highlights the fact that an average of three people per day die in need of an organ. as someone who was a cardiac nurse in a previous job, i am only too aware of how desperate a patient can become when waiting for an organ to become available. i saw at first hand the distress that people suffered while waiting for a heart transplant or for another organ. in spain and belgium, a softer opt - out approach has facilitated a cultural change that has generated higher donor rates. that is why i am here today supporting my hon. friend ' s bill, which will address this bleak statistic and bring the discussion of organ donation back to the dinner tables of families across the uk. i also express my sincere thanks to the daily mirror for its campaign in support of the bill, which has shown the public the gift of life that is given by those who donate organs. one organ donor can transform as many as nine people ' s lives. as has been mentioned, the uk has one of the lowest family consent rates in europe. in wales, the welsh government bravely introduced deemed consent.""]"

the existing availability of talent and a future pipeline, including educational links ; local connectivity and broader infrastructure ; ease and speed of travel for channel 4 employees and partners between the different creative hubs ;

the importance of communication in general ; and equality - they likened learning bsl to learning french or spanish and said that bsl was at least equally important. they thought that being able to use bsl would improve employment prospects, both directly and indirectly, but many did not know of anywhere they could learn it at no or little cost. i have already mentioned the shortage of qualified teachers of the deaf, but there is a wider shortage. in 2017, the department for work and pensions highlighted that shortages in sign language interpreters have resulted in higher costs for government programmes such as access to work, and have made it harder for deaf people to enter the workplace. a gcse could lead to more people considering interpreting for deaf people as a career. i do not want to make this petition downbeat."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr stringer. on 5 march i had the great privilege of presenting a debate in response to the e - petition on making british sign language a part of the curriculum. much of that debate was about giving deaf children the best possible chance of communicating with other people and the best educational outcomes. sadly, attainment evidence shows that is not happening at present. i want to talk about services for deaf children at a much earlier stage in the education system. i am sorry to have to do that ; the latest figures show that services for deaf children are reducing across england. that means that their futures are being a€œstolena€, as the national deaf children ' s society puts it, because without the support, intervention and specialist skills that they need, they will not be able to make the best educational and social progress compared with other children who are not deaf or hearing impaired. that cannot be right. there are more than 50, 000 deaf children and young people in the uk. as we have heard, more than 90 % of them are born to hearing parents who have no prior experience of deafness. some 80 % of those children attend mainstream schools, where they may be the only deaf child in their school. figures from the national deaf children ' s society show a stark difference in educational achievement as it is. in the early years foundation stage, 34 % of pre - school deaf children were reported as having a good level of development compared with 76 % of other children. at key stage 2, less than half of deaf children achieved the expected standard for reading, compared with 80 % of other children. at key stage 4, deaf children achieve, on average, a whole grade less in each gcse subject than other children. in recent years this attainment gap has widened."", ""i thank my hon. friend for that intervention. i agree with that statement, and i hope to explain why. the petitioners want bsl to be part of the national curriculum, giving better life chances to young people who are deaf. they believe that if bsl becomes part of the national curriculum, that will even up the chances of deaf young people being able to play a full part in school and attain the best results they can. let us look at the case. research by the national deaf children ' s society into the attainment of deaf children in 2017 shows that deaf children continue to underachieve throughout their education compared with other children. although the department for education claimed recently that attainment for deaf children is at an all - time high, the latest figures show that the attainment gap between deaf children and children with no identified special needs is widening, with the gap at gcse level being particularly worrying. in 2016, 41. 3 % of deaf children achieved the expected benchmark of five gcses at a * to c grade, compared with 69. 3 % of children with no identified special needs. that is a difference of more than 20 %, which is just not acceptable in this day and age. all that is in the context of a reduction of 14 % in the number of qualified teachers of the deaf since 2011, and a 2 % reduction in just one year - 2016 - 17. we know that we have to do more to help deaf pupils to achieve their full potential and that we need to reverse the reduction in the number of teachers of the deaf. we can do that partly by ensuring that young deaf pupils are able to have effective communication. for many, that will be through bsl. bsl has been a recognised language since 2003, but unlike other languages it is not recognised as a gcse that can be taught in schools.""]"

members on all sides are therefore rightly concerned that no such approval was sought by the government prior to the air strikes against syrian government installations, to which the uk was a party last friday night, alongside the usa and france. indeed, this house was not only denied a vote, but did not even have the opportunity to question the government in advance on the legal and evidential basis for their participation in this action, on their new strategy in regard to syrian intervention, or on why they acted before the conclusion of the ongoing inspection in douma by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons. members will also be concerned that these strikes have been explicitly presented, by the government and by the united states, as a possible precursor to even stronger intervention against the syrian regime if that is judged to be necessary."", 'these are indeed grave and difficult decisions for a prime minister and a government to take, but it is important that anybody in the position of prime minister recognises that there will sometimes be times when it is necessary to commit our armed forces into combat in some shape or form, be that in the more direct defence of our land or our interests, in defence of international norms, or for the prevention of humanitarian suffering. it is imperative that the person who occupies this position is able and willing to take such decisions. i share completely the principle that, in a parliamentary democracy, elected representatives in this house should be able to debate the deployment of british military forces into combat. as i said yesterday, i am deeply conscious of the gravity of these decisions and the way in which they affect all members of the house. there are situations - not least major deployments like the iraq war - when the scale of the military build - up requires the movement of military assets over weeks, and when it is absolutely right and appropriate for parliament to debate military action in advance, but that does not mean that that is always appropriate. this therefore cannot and should not be codified into a parliamentary right to debate every possible overseas mission in advance.', ""i start by paying tribute to the professionalism, dedication and courage of our armed forces. as i said in the house yesterday, there is no graver decision for a prime minister than to commit our servicemen and women to combat operations. understanding where authority and accountability for their deployment and employment lies is of vital importance. let me begin by being absolutely clear about the government ' s policy in relation to the convention that has developed, because there is a fundamental difference between the policy and the perception of it that is conveyed in today ' s motion. the cabinet manual states : a€œin 2011, the government acknowledged that a convention had developed in parliament that before troops were committed the house of commons should have an opportunity to debate the matter and said that it proposed to observe that convention except where there was an emergency and such action would not be appropriate. a€more detail on the government ' s position was then set out in 2016 in a written ministerial statement from the then defence secretary, my right hon. friend the member for sevenoaks ( sir michael fallon ), who wrote : a€œthe exception to the convention is important to ensure that this and future governments can use their judgment about how best to protect the security and interests of the uk. in observing the convention, we must ensure that the ability of our armed forces to act quickly and decisively, and to maintain the security of their operations, is not compromised... if we were to attempt to clarify more precisely circumstances in which we would consult parliament before taking military action, we would constrain the operational flexibility of the armed forces and prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of those forcesa€ -""]"

i went back to work very early, having just started my own business, and found myself suddenly with a very sick three - month - old child. i had stopped my parental leave and needed to go back into hospital. should a parent be able to restart their leave? those are challenging issues that one would need to look at as the system evolves, which is why i support the idea of introducing proxy voting with a trial. we can then see how it evolves. my suggestion is that it should just be for parental leave - fathers and mothers of babies, including adopted babies - and not widened out to other issues at this stage, even though people need time off.']"

what about the huge number of existing meters that will be removed and need to be disposed of as smart meters are installed? those meters are not owned by installers but by meter asset providers that finance and ultimately own the meters that are put in. it has been a long - standing arrangement in the industry that meters are not owned by the suppliers but merely read by the suppliers. that means that when a programme is pursued of removing old meters, whether dumb meters or previous generation smart meters, there is a problem in identifying whose meters they are. the difficulty that we are facing right now - it is not a problem for the future - is that we might see meter mountains arising in this country because the people who are removing the meters do not know who their owners are or who is going to take them away and recycle and dispose of them. i do not want to see, as a result of this roll - out programme, meter mountains, or alps, appearing across the country.', ""as the hon. gentleman said, i am convinced that consumers will get the benefit from smart meters. in this day and age, it is absurd that people - i include myself - have to read their meters on their hands and knees, with a torch and a duster to remove the cobwebs and everything else. i think that the hon. gentleman would agree that that is an intolerable situation and that smart meters are the cure. let me respond to the shadow minister ' s comments about progress to date. there are now over 8. 6 million smart and advanced meters operating across homes and small businesses across great britain. nearly 400, 000 smart meters - obviously they affect a lot more people, because of the number of people per household - are installed every month as suppliers ramp up their delivery, and that figure is increasing significantly every quarter. the government are committed to ensuring that all homes and small businesses are offered smart meters by the end of 2020. let me turn to new clause 1. future smart meter communication licensees will need to demonstrate that they are a a€œfit and proper persona€ to carry out relevant functions. that will include factors such as the ownership of the proposed licensee, but it is not appropriate to judge suitability solely on that basis, nor to exclude non - gb companies by default. doing so would risk failing to deliver value for money for consumers, which could undermine the effectiveness of the smart meter system. i also emphasise that the government take the national security implications of foreign control and ownership seriously. we have powers under the enterprise act 2002 to intervene in mergers and takeovers that give rise to public interest concerns, including about national security. new clause 2 is about the technical development of smart meters. overall, we expect that more than 99. 25 % of premises will be covered by the national communications network.""]"

i have spoken to a number of different people with different views. the hon. member for wimbledon said that he had spoken to the ambassador and the professor himself. i note the comments of the norwegian prime minister in august last year, when she said that the uk joining efta, even for a temporary period, would be a a€œchallenging and costlya€ undertaking. again, those concerns are not insurmountable, but we need to grapple with how realistic this option is and, in particular, with whether efta ' s institutions - especially its court - could cope with the volume of cases that would land in them if the uk was to join efta. all of that speaks to a wider point, which is that the four efta economies are very different from the uk economy. the size of the efta countries and the nature of their economies make uk membership of efta a challenging prospect. all of that needs to be debated, and it cannot be debated in an hour and a half in westminster hall. the efta option should not be taken off the table, but there are real reasons why the labour party believes that a bespoke deal following a transitional arrangement on basic terms should be what we are aiming for, and therefore eea / efta would not be our first preference. however, as i say, the key point is that that option should not be taken off the table. in the end, it is up to parliament to decide, which is why it is so important that we have a meaningful vote -"", ""i must continue because i do not have much time, and efta has been a big issue in this debate. i will give way if i have time after my comments - i hope the hon. gentleman will have patience with me. several hon. members have raised efta membership today as the main alternative. although we recognise the benefits of ensuring continuity in our relationships with the efta states, we have no plans to seek membership of the efta agreement for four key reasons. first, efta is a trading bloc of four countries. membership of efta does not in itself deliver any market access to the eu. norway, iceland and liechtenstein effectively participate in the eu single market by virtue of the eea agreement. that would not deliver more direct control over decisions affecting the uk, nor would it deliver control over migration, which is a key aspect of our leaving the eu. switzerland participates in some areas of the single market through a series of bilateral agreements with the eu, but many of those do not cover the areas in which the uk has interests. in any case, the government have made clear on a number of occasions that we are not pursuing an off - the - shelf arrangement ; we are not copying and pasting other agreements. we are seeking a particular bespoke agreement relevant to the uk ' s economy. the model i have been discussing does not strike the right balance on democratic control and mutual market access that we want in our future partnership with the eu. secondly, our ambition as a global trading nation goes beyond the scope of efta ' s existing free trade agreements with third countries. efta ' s ftas are not suited to the size and type of the economy in britain. they are not with the larger economies of the world - countries and economies with whom we would wish to be pursuing new economic partnerships."", ""i start by congratulating my hon. friend the member for wimbledon ( stephen hammond ) on securing this important debate on the european free trade association, to which i am delighted to respond. i note that he beat our hon. friend the member for eddisbury ( antoinette sandbach ) in securing this debate, but as my hon. friend and colleague at dexeu, the member for wycombe ( mr baker ), said in the house on 1 february, a number of colleagues have suggested efta membership as a possible option, and it is important that we debate it. although we recognise the benefits of ensuring continuity in our relationships with the efta states, we do not plan to seek membership of efta, for four key reasons. first, efta membership in and of itself does not deliver any market access to the eu. as my hon. friend the member for wimbledon pointed out, there are some misconceptions. it is important to delineate the difference between the efta agreement and the eea. efta is a trading bloc between four european countries : switzerland, norway, iceland and liechtenstein. three of them participate in the eu ' s single market through the eea agreement, while switzerland participates in some areas through a series of bilateral arrangements with the eu. as such, joining efta does not say anything about our future economic partnership with the eu. those calling for us to join the efta need to be more specific, as my hon. friend was, about whether they mean joining the eea, or attempting to copy the swiss agreement, or negotiating a different bespoke agreement.""]"

the use of the private sector has been progressed by successive governments over many years. the present government blame labour for introducing private finance initiatives, which they say have burdened the nhs with eye - watering debts, but the government compounded the problem through pf2. they also blame labour for opening up the nhs to marketisation by splitting primary care trusts into commissioning and provider arms, and introducing the concept of a€œany preferred providera€ in its transforming community services programme, even though the secretary of state at the time, andy burnham, expressly stated that the nhs would always be the preferred provider of services. yet from 2010 onwards this government extended that model, creating clinical commissioning groups and pursuing competition and commercialisation with renewed vigour. today, therefore, many traditional public health services are run by private providers such as virgin care and gp consortiums in their own right - services such as out - of - hours urgent care, sexual health and mental health residential care. the health and social care act 2012 was designed to bring in a far greater private sector element to the nhs through expansion of the internal market. since then, the privatisation picture has been more mixed than had been feared, not only as a result of campaigns by unison, the gmb and others, but because various government initiatives to boost privatisation fell flat. however, there is still significant evidence of increasing privatisation, with companies such as virgin, serco and spire continuing to prosper.']"

i never entered politics with the intention of becoming a baby loss awareness campaigner. as with so many in this field, the loss of a child - my son in 2014 - brought about my interest and desire to bring about change. and being a member of this house, gives every one of us the platform to make a difference. it can be a small change that affects just one of our constituents, or it can be something larger that affects everyone in the uk. i am proud that through my role in this house i have been able to play even just a small part in the development and roll - out of the national bereavement care pathway, which is something that will make a difference to tens of thousands of bereaved parents and families up and down the country. before i move on to the pathway itself, i want to pay tribute to you, mr speaker. you have been hugely supportive of our baby loss awareness campaigning efforts in this place, and i know i speak for all members of the all - party group on baby loss when i say a heart - felt thank you. launched last year at 11 sites across england, the pathway has been developed by a number of baby loss charities, royal colleges and professional organisations with the support of the department of health and social care and the appg. it is designed to improve the quality of bereavement care experienced by parents and families at all stages of pregnancy and baby loss up to 12 months. the pathway provides a practical framework for all those healthcare and other professionals involved and has been informed and led by the views of bereaved parents at every stage of its development.']"

the question is how it is done in a way that ensures that the police service operates correctly. it is not just politicians who say that - 35 % of btp officers and 45 % of btp staff in scotland say that they would probably leave the service if this integration went through. they have a great deal of pride in the service and safety that they provide to the public. before my nationalist colleagues jump up and say that i am talking the police service down, let me say that the entirety of the police service - btp and the police in my constituency - do a fantastic job in incredibly difficult circumstances. great damage is being done to police scotland because of the botched merger of all the police forces to create that body, not because of individual officers, who do as much as they possibly can on the ground with the slim pickings of resources they are given. to see how bad this integration would be, it is worth thinking about one of the basic grassroots issues - trains."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered proposals for the merger of british transport police scottish division with police scotland. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr hollobone. we had a slight wait for you to take the chair, but i know better than most that the match cannot start without a referee, so it is good to have you in your place. i thank the backbench business committee for allowing us time for this debate, as well as all right hon. and hon. members who supported the application - in particular, the hon. member for east lothian ( martin whitfield ), who joined me in front of that committee to present our case for the debate. i refer members to my declaration in the register of members ' financial interests. my wife is a serving police officer : a police sergeant with police scotland. i want to divide my remarks into three sections : the process from the smith commission to the vote in the scottish parliament approving the proposed merger ; where the process got to and the pause announced last month ; and finally, the next steps and, i hope, the opportunities for the british transport police scottish division. early in my remarks - before any scottish national party members jump up with interventions diligently provided to them by party researchers - i would like to note that the merger of the british transport police into police scotland is wholly different from what was proposed in the conservative manifesto. i strongly opposed from the outset the snp plans in scotland. our plans in the uk manifesto pledged to protect specialist policing at a uk level by bringing together the civil nuclear constabulary, the ministry of defence police and british transport police."", 'as an example, the scottish government say that they would take the 280 or so full - time equivalent btp officers in scotland and merge them into police scotland with its 17, 234 officers. that would not protect them, because if the officers within police scotland who wish to have a specialism in railway policing were first on the scene at a non - railway incident, they would be stuck with that incident right the way through. currently, if police scotland are the first on scene at the railways, they can transfer that to a btp officer when they arrive and vice versa. they could not do that. that is not protecting the current situation and the good work done by btp officers in scotland and across the country. my opposition and the strong opposition from scottish conservatives in westminster and holyrood must not be considered as disrespecting the smith commission and devolution settlement that followed. i agree that the functions of the british transport police in scotland should be a devolved matter - i just strongly disagree with the approach taken by the snp government. there were and are other options to devolve the powers, but we know that they were never considered by the scottish government. right from the start, the snp had a blinkered view on its approach - unwilling to listen to expert advice, which opposed its plans, and unwilling to listen to the views of btp officers, the british transport police federation, rail unions and rail operators. basically, everyone with considerable knowledge of railway policing warned the snp against the plans, but they were ignored and the snp marched on regardless. it only consulted on its preferred option : full integration with police scotland.']"

we will retain the bonds of friendship, security and trade that have united britain and europe for so long. if we want to achieve that, before we leave the european union we must put in place the essential legal powers and structures that will enable the uk to operate an independent trade policy. that is what our trade legislation is designed to achieve. in this, as in all our legislation, the department for international trade will be guided by what delivers the greatest economic advantage to the uk and ensures the continued confidence of our partners and allies. the bill contains six delegated powers allowing the government to make regulations to support and develop their trade policy. two of the powers allow the government to amend primary legislation ; they relate to ensuring the continuity of eu trade agreements into a uk - only context and to the collection of exporter information by her majesty ' s revenue and customs. both powers are subject to significant restrictions on how they can be used. the trade agreement continuity powers are limited in scope ; in particular, they can be used to amend primary legislation only when it forms part of retained eu law. we intend to use the powers to make necessary amendments to domestic legislation as part of the transition project. by taking those powers, we can be sure that we have the ability to implement efficiently all obligations of existing trade agreements in our new context. the eu ' s trade agreements, which we intend to transition and which are within the scope of this bill, will have already been scrutinised by parliament ' s eu committees. free trade agreements that the uk has already ratified have also been through the normal parliamentary scrutiny process."", ""indeed, i do rise to speak to new clause 3, which is in my name and signed by more than 50 members of the house from four different parties, and i give notice that i would like to move it when it comes to the votes. this amendment essentially seeks to remedy the bill ' s failure to provide for a proper role for parliamentarians in the scrutiny and approval of trade agreements. at present, trade agreements can be negotiated, or renegotiated as is likely to be the case with many of the existing eu trade deals covered by this bill, entirely under royal prerogative powers, essentially giving the government free rein to decide when and with whom to start negotiations, to set their own priorities and objectives, to conduct the negotiations in great secrecy, and to conclude the deal without any meaningful parliamentary scrutiny. that not only sidelines members of this house, but it prevents valuable input by civil society organisations and the wider public. this bill is supposed to help implement an independent trade policy following withdrawal from the eu, but it does nothing to put in place the kind of scrutiny and approval framework that should be required for an accountable trade policy in a modern democratic country. and this is the only legislative opportunity we are likely to have to put such a framework in place. in his statement yesterday, the secretary of state for international trade once again sought to make a distinction between replacements for existing eu trade deals and future trade deals, but the fact is that effective parliamentary scrutiny and approval is needed for both, for it is increasingly clear that, contrary to the hope of ministers, it is not going to be a simple case of transitioning, or a€œrolling over, a€ existing eu trade deals. some or all of the countries in question are not simply going to be content to continue with the existing arrangements, and ministers will have little choice but to negotiate a replacement deal."", ""in october last year, my department published a white paper, a€œpreparing for our future uk trade policya€, in which we set out the government ' s commitment to transparency and inclusiveness in our future trading arrangements. the paper also set out our intention to boost our trade relationships with old friends and new allies, expanding access to markets across the globe. today, i can set out the role of parliament, the devolved administrations, public, business and civil society, and how the government intend to engage with those groups as we embark on our new international trade agreements to benefit the whole uk and ensure we meet our commitments to an inclusive and transparent trade policy. scrutiny of our future trade arrangements is vital as we take powers back from the eu into uk law and begin negotiating our own new free trade agreements. i would like, at this stage, to make a distinction between our free trade agreements with new partners, to which this statement relates, and continuity trade agreements - those being legislated for in the trade bill tomorrow and to which the customs bill powers being debated today will also apply. with that distinction in mind, for our new ftas we will now put in place a structured approach to engagement to provide clarity on how stakeholders can feed into this vital work that will help to shape the trading future of our country. to ensure that our new agreements and future trade policy work for the whole uk, it is vital that parliament, the devolved administrations, local government, business, trade unions, civil society and the public from every part of the uk have the opportunity to engage and contribute from the outset of the process. on parliament specifically, the government are committed to providing parliament with the ability to inform and scrutinise new trade agreements in a timely and appropriate manner. i want to set out how this will be achieved.""]"

it can be an invisible disability that is not recognised. this evening i will talk about the issues facing children with acquired brain injury, particularly in education, which was one of the topics on which the appg heard evidence. department of health data shows that in a four - year period, 39, 000 under five were admitted to hospital because of falls. many of these children will be discharged as fully recovered, although the outcome of traumatic brain injuries in children may not become clear until their brain is fully matured. in fact, despite the early years being a key point in brain development, it is also the time when children are most vulnerable to injury. sadly, it is also the least supported age group. the appg heard from the child brain injury trust in one of our meetings that children are very different from adults after acquired brain injury, because their brains are still developing and will continue to do so until they are in their mid - 20s.']"

to require banks to enable free cash withdrawals from current accounts in other circumstances ; to require the financial conduct authority to supervise an access to banking standard ; to impose penalties for breaches of that standard ; to establish a financial inclusion fund, and provide for amounts received in such penalties to be paid into that fund ; and for connected purposes. recently link, which set the funding formula for atm operators, consulted its members on proposals to reduce from 25p to 20p the interchange fee paid to atm operators by banks when cash is withdrawn. the first phase of the cut will take place on 1 july 2018. this proposed reduction in the funding formula has led to concerns that many atms will become financially unviable and therefore may be forced to close or charge a fee to remain in use. the bill seeks to remove the option for atms to become fee - charging by banning fees. i take this position, first and foremost, out of principle, as i do not believe that anyone should have to pay to access their own money. however, a ban on atm charges makes it a practical necessity that an appropriate funding formula for free - to - use atms be devised. in supporting this objective, the bill seeks to provide a legal requirement for access to cash withdrawals through atms or other means where there is a demand for it. such demand would be established through a full market review of the atm network by the payment systems regulator. there has been no recent review of the demand for access to cash, and as we transition towards a cashless society it is important that we fully and comprehensively establish where demand remains for cash in order to target resources effectively.']"

the question is the extent to which they can be tailored or lifted to suit appropriate local circumstances. first, however, let me say something about accessibility issues. our london taxis have a fantastic record : all 21, 000 are wheelchair - accessible, but the story is not the same across the country. i am told that in metropolitan areas outside london, 83 % of taxis are wheelchair - accessible, but in some rural areas the figure falls as low as 15 %. one of the challenges that we face is making our taxi and private hire fleet more accessible to people throughout the country. there is a lot of variation in the approach to disability awareness training, which only 41 % of local authorities require for taxi drivers and only 38 % require for private hire vehicle drivers. over the past few years, the percentage of local authorities that require taxi and private hire vehicle drivers to complete training on the subject of child sexual abuse or exploitation has risen to 70 %, partly in response to some very sad incidents in some parts of the country. however, that leaves nearly 100 licensing authorities that still do not require drivers to undertake such training. i became interested in the subject when i had the privilege of serving as a shadow transport minister for a couple of years. when i later had the opportunity to introduce a private member ' s bill, i chose to try to do something about safety issues, on which there is cross - party consensus. since i introduced my bill - the licensing of taxis and private hire vehicles ( safeguarding and road safety ) bill - some 18 months ago, i have had the opportunity to discuss the issue with enforcement officers and officials from knowsley to london and with taxi and private hire firms from brighton to manchester.""]"

overall, the co2 emissions of a diesel car tend to be lower, diesel fuel contains more energy per litre than petrol and diesel engines are more efficient than petrol engines, especially in rural environments. modern euro 6 diesel cars are the cleanest in history : they capture 99 % of particulates and emit 84 % fewer nox emissions than in 2000. so, we know that new diesels do not compare to the older ones. we also know from data from the society of motor manufacturers and traders that average co2 emissions from cars sold in 2017 were higher than in 2016, reversing a near 20 - year decline. they blame that increase on the demonisation of diesel since 2015, which means that we cannot take for granted the progress made in reducing co2 emissions since 2000. we are heading in the wrong direction, as diesel sales have fallen by 37 % since last year. mike hawes, smmt chief executive, criticised the autumn budget, which increased taxes on sales of new diesels. he commented that people were concerned about these tax increases and werea€œholding off buying new diesel cars because of the confusion and that means older, dirtier diesels are staying on the roads. a€that is precisely the point made by the hon. member for solihull ( julian knight ). nick molden, chief executive of testing company emissions analytics, agreed that, rather than impose higher taxes on new cars, the oldest cars and dirtiest diesel cars should be targeted instead.', ""as has been mentioned, this sector has been one of britain ' s greatest manufacturing success stories, providing thousands of jobs and a major contribution to our country ' s economic growth. the story of my own constituency ' s past cannot be told without an understanding of the sector, dominated by ford ' s dagenham plant, which at its height employed some 40, 000 workers. today, dagenham ' s two engine plants produce 1 million diesel engines annually - 50 % of ford ' s global diesel requirement - and provide over 3, 000 jobs. some 89 % of those engines are exported. the total turnover stands at a£1. 75 billion. however, investment in britain ' s car industry has halved during the past two years. brexit concerns and the demonization of diesel appear to be the two biggest challenges. the crisis of confidence in diesel vehicles and diesel technology was triggered by volkswagen ' s emissions scandal, but the upshot has been damage to not just vw but the whole sector. i am not seeking to defend older diesel engines, which, in truth, are more polluting than their petrol counterparts. however, we must bring some nuance back into the debate. all diesel technology is being tarred with the same brush, despite the fact that state - of - the - art diesel technology is a vast improvement over its predecessors. as has been mentioned, those dirtier engines will, ironically, be kept on the road longer if consumers are misinformed about the difference between diesel technologies. it is clean - diesel technology that is being invested in in dagenham. ford invested a£490 million in developing clean, cutting - edge diesel technology in dagenham in 2014. this new generation of clean engines meets the euro 6 emissions standards and satisfies transport for london ' s ultra - low emission zone."", ""that shows the cross - party agreement on some of the points i am making today. the trouble is that in the uk, germany, france and spain - the markets where anti - diesel rhetoric is highest - diesel consumption is declining fastest. sales of diesel cars have slumped as regulators and politicians announce plans for bans, levies and additional taxes in many cities. in truth, we in dagenham fear that diesel has become a bit of a political football. in 2001, gordon brown introduced a new system of car tax aimed at protecting the environment - a sliding scale to make it cheaper for cars with lower co2 emissions. that helped stimulate a dash for diesel after its introduction in 2001 and its extension in subsequent years. there are now some 12 million diesel cars on british roads, while back in 2000 there were only 3 million. in recent years, diesel has accounted for around half of the new car market. in 2000, by comparison, only one in seven new cars was a diesel model, yet following a 2017 bbc report on the dangers of diesel, the environment secretary jumped into the debate to make political capital : a€œthe dash for diesel was pursued under a labour government... this is yet another example of a conservative government having to clean up labour ' s mess... we are taking action... ending the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040. a€political game playing should have no role, given the challenges facing the sector, as reflected in the comments made by colleagues across the house today. since the 2015 vw revelations, cities have taken the lead over national governments.""]"

the rationale for excluding flour from fortification is unclear. there is clearly strong support for that among members of the medical profession."", ""it is a pleasure to be here under your chairmanship, mr hanson. i congratulate the hon. member for pontypridd ( owen smith ) on securing this important debate and on the eloquent and cogent way that he set out the case for the fortification of flour with folic acid. when the facts are set out and the evidence is adduced, it is a very compelling case. it is all the more surprising, when one hears the weighted evidence of the arguments in favour of it, that something has not yet been done in this country to ensure the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid. the hon. gentleman said that that has happened in many major countries across the world with vast populations. he mentioned brazil, the united states and canada ; they are big countries with very strong regulatory regimes in which this practice has been carried out. therefore, there have been multiple opportunities to have all the scientific evidence evaluated and to have all the upsides and downsides considered. it is very clear that the upsides are so massive that they require this country to follow suit. it is a shame that we are not yet in a position in this country to have mandatory fortification of flour. it has been 27 years since the medical research council published its research demonstrating that supplementing women ' s diets with folic acid before the early stages of pregnancy reduced the chances of the pregnancy being affected by neural tube defects. that was in 1991. it was in 1990 that my son, andrew, was born with spina bifida. very soon after he was born, we became experts in the whole area of spina bifida : the reasons for it, how it develops and all the rest of it.""]"

the aspect of fees that i personally have greatest difficulty with is the profit that the home office makes on the applications. of the a£1, 012 that is charged, a£372 is the cost of administration and almost two thirds is profit. the free movement website estimates that the home office has made nearly a£100 million in profits over the past five years.', 'if the hon. gentleman allows me to make some progress, i will turn to the points he made in his opening speech. during 2017 - 18, about 64, 000 people were granted indefinite leave to remain and 123, 000 were granted citizenship. of those granted citizenship, more than 28, 000 were minor children who were registered and were related to a british citizen, or children granted citizenship on a discretionary basis. in all cases the applicants either paid the due fee or had that fee paid on their behalf, reflecting the value placed on permanent residence and citizenship in the uk. the charging framework for visa and immigration services delivered a£1. 35 billion of income in the last financial year, 2017 - 18. that helped to fund more than a£620 million of costs associated with other immigration system functions, helping to maintain their effectiveness and security, and investment in ongoing service improvement. setting fees at above the cost of processing an application has also helped us to set some fees at below cost - for example, short - term visit visas, in recognition of the significant economic benefits that tourists and other visitors bring to the whole of the uk. the subsidy for the circa 2. 5 million short - term visit visas issued each year costs in the region of a£90 million per annum, which can be afforded only by setting a wide range of other fees. let me make one other obvious point : setting fees at the level that we do - putting the burden on those who benefit from the services - reduces the burden on the exchequer and on the general taxpayers of this country. it is easy, particularly in opposition, to call for fees or taxes to be reduced, but a responsible government must balance the books. the loss of income that would result from any reduction in fees would have to be made up elsewhere, and there have been rather fewer suggestions of how that might be achieved.']"

quality parks and green spaces now and for future generations. the government are committed to ensuring that our parks and open spaces continue to provide vibrant and inclusive places for local communities to enjoy. local parks are great at connecting communities and encouraging interaction between younger and older generations and between people from different backgrounds. i recognise that to achieve that shared goal we need to support local councils to deliver it, so it may be helpful if i set out what the government are doing to support the hon. lady ' s local area and, more broadly, if i touch on some of the activity the government are undertaking to safeguard parks and open spaces. on overall funding for local government, this government believe strongly that local people who know and understand their community are best placed to decide how funding should be spent in their area. that is why funding provided through the local government finance settlement is largely not ring - fenced, as it allows local authorities, which are independent of central government, to manage their budgets in line with local priorities. in practice, that means there is no specific funding stream for parks, just as there is not for waste services or children ' s services, for example. local communities are best placed to decide on their own local priorities."", 'i absolutely agree. that is the thrust of my speech tonight, and i have already detailed the effects of cuts to budgets for policing and public services. it would be easy to ask the minister to consider making parks statutory services, so that councils could be held to account more easily for their maintenance. however, my local parks would not be helped one bit by that without the government backing up the change with serious funding for local authorities to meet this requirement. labour and the conservatives have different views about local authority funding, and i do not think that we will resolve this difference tonight. as much as local authorities can innovate in developing and maintaining parks, it appears to be an unfortunate truth that there will always be higher costs. i ask the minister specifically to ensure that councils have enough capital funds to create parks that are resilient to the challenges they can face. i also ask him to work with the minister for sport to ensure that lottery funds specifically support parks facing difficulties with misuse and the lack of commercial income that i have outlined. as welcome as the a€œparks for peoplea€ programme was, its focus on heritage meant that parks in the most challenging areas sometimes lost out in favour of parks in traditionally leafier suburbs. i thank members and the minister for attending tonight. i also thank local people, interested organisations and local parks officers who all offered a wealth of information, so much of which i could not touch on tonight. i hope that i can make a small contribution to ensuring that we have resilient parks and green spaces in every part of my constituency and in every city. maintaining and improving parks for every citizen is an absolute necessity if we want to create a more equal, healthy and happy society.', ""even amidst the most built -

needed environment in which children without access to other opportunities can enjoy being children. in an era of extreme loneliness and isolation, they are bringing people of all ages together, and in an age of unprecedented privatisation and commercialisation of public space, they remain free for everyone to use and benefit from. according to the indices of multiple deprivation, my constituency is one of the most deprived in the country. government figures suggest that we might expect to see far fewer parks and open spaces in such areas than in wealthier areas. however, sheffield, brightside and hillsborough, despite its legacy as a highly urban formerly industrial area, is an exception to this, having substantial areas of parks and open space across the constituency. sheffield can lay claim to being the greenest city in europe, with a third of our city boundary lying within the peak district and a history of prestigious prizes won, including the 2005 entente florale gold medal. we are blessed with hundreds of parks and open spaces, and residents have access to a huge range of facilities, from small play parks to ancient woodlands. the national trust funded research in 2016 on sheffield ' s parks, which highlighted the huge value and benefit they hold for local people and the financial value that they represent to health and other public services.""]"

it is prison staff on the ground, working in unsafe conditions and at increased risk of attack ; the prisoners in their care ; and society as a whole. the cuts have led to dangerous situations in our prisons and have cost lives. the howard league report of 2016, a€œpreventing prison suicide, a€ damningly concluded thata€œstaff shortages have increased the risk of suicidea€in our prisons. there was a cut of almost 7, 000 frontline officers - austerity measures. was there a risk assessment prior to the prison officer reduction of 7, 000? i very much doubt it. i would like to see it, if there was one."", ""i absolutely do. the institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience at king ' s college london estimates that more than half of prisoners may have common mental disorders, including depression, post - traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, and believes that 15 % of prisoners have more specialist needs. those are significant figures, but guesstimates are not good enough. the most commonly used estimate, which is that 90 % of prisoners have mental health issues, dates from 1998 - 20 years ago. the government have no idea of the scale of the problem. the ministry of justice must address that to plan services and meet needs. the national audit office has recently stated : a€œgovernment does not collect enough, or good enough, data about mental health in prisons, which makes it hard to plan services and monitor outcomes. a€it particularly criticised nhs england for the data collected, whicha€œdo not measure outcomes for prisoners, continuity of care or service quality. a€how damning! this failure to monitor poor mental health levels and the mental health services provided in prison simply would not happen in the outside world. it is costing our citizens their wellbeing and sometimes their lives. let us remember, it is also costing the taxpayer. the lack of knowledge about prisoners ' mental health exists at all stages of the cycle : on entry to prison, a point raised by my hon. friend the member for stretford and urmston ( kate green ) ; during their stay in prison ; and after they leave. this means that future prison needs, present prison needs and community needs, and consequently budget requirements, cannot possibly be accurately planned for. for instance, what consideration was given, and finance afforded, to the detained historical sexual abusers? these are elderly people with age - related health needs, such as heart conditions, dementia, diabetes and cancer."", ""that is a well - made point. prevention and looking at early diversion and picking up mental health issues where they are the significant issue at play in someone ' s offending is crucial. assessment is more difficult for prison staff and mental health staff in a short - stay prison. i hope the minister will look at that. there is a high volume of prisoners in short - stay prisons. they come and go in a very short time and it is difficult to get all of the services properly in place, so that will need resourcing. it would help to address those issues. co - morbidity has been raised, which is extremely important. we have already heard that many people develop drug problems in prison. that is in fact true and much more must be done to prevent drugs coming into prison, but we also need substance misuse programmes in prison and we need to be mindful of liaison with drug and alcohol services on release, because one of the greatest risks of overdose is when someone has come off drugs in prison and then starts again as soon as they leave. so that is another area of vulnerability. we must look at particularly vulnerable offenders and services for women and young offenders. we also need an increased awareness of autism in prison. there is a high risk of suicide within that community, particularly if they are incarcerated. in my experience, far too many of our veterans go into prison. we are failing them, frankly. they have experienced conflict and high levels of trauma, so we really need services and programmes that support them when they come back from active duty. we must prevent them from feeling they are no longer able to cope and committing offences. will the minister also address the availability of programmes in prison for mental health coping skills, cognitive behaviour therapy and managing mental illness programmes? what progress has there been on that?""]"

nautilus, the seafarers union, which has already been mentioned ; or global framework agreements with the international union of food, agricultural, hotel, restaurant, catering, tobacco and allied workers associations. the government can also do more."", ""the hon. lady is absolutely right. the debate around how we change the culture of our cheap clothing and cheap food is about making sure that our consumers are as well informed as they can be when they go out to do their shopping, whether to buy clothes or groceries. when the public see the cost behind the cheap price, many are moved to change how they shop and what they buy. across 12 common products including tea, orange juice and bananas, uk supermarkets receive almost 10 times more of the checkout price than the small - scale farmers and workers who produce them. the uk supermarkets ' market share rose from 41 % in 1996 to nearly 53 % in 2015 and, as the hon. member for bristol east demonstrated, this represents a race to the bottom in terms of what is paid to suppliers. oxfam and the sustainable seafood alliance indonesia examined the working conditions in prawn processing plants and exporters in thailand and indonesia respectively, which supply some of the world ' s biggest supermarkets, including the six uk supermarkets. workers described forced pregnancy tests, unsafe working conditions, poverty wages, strictly controlled bathroom and water breaks, and verbal abuse. supermarkets should lead the way ethically if positive change is to happen in our food supply chains. that is why oxfam ' s new supermarkets scorecard, which rates and ranks the most powerful uk supermarkets on the strength of their public policies and practices to address human rights and social sustainability, should be welcomed. these challenging benchmarks, based on robust and international standards, and widely recognised best practice on transparency, accountability and the treatment of workers, small - scale farmers and women in supply chains, will allow our consumers across the uk to make more informed choices. they will help to effect change in supermarkets ' practices and encourage them to address the suffering in their supply chains.""]"

i mean giving us a simple answer on whether consumer debt is higher or lower. my understanding from bank of england and office for budget responsibility data is that consumer credit - unsecured loans - is up by 19 % since 2010. car financing - a huge new area of secured personal debt - has added a£30 billion in the same timeframe. student debt under this government has doubled to nearly a£100 billion. in real terms, there has been a 7 % increase since 2010 in consumer personal debt - the second highest figure in the g8 economies after that in canada. some clarification on that point would be welcome. it is estimated that over 8 million adults in the uk struggle with problem personal debt - the issue we are debating today - resulting in bankruptcy or individual voluntary arrangements. many people are in that situation because of unexpected life events, be that a job loss, an illness or a breakdown in relationships. the debt charity step change, which has been mentioned on multiple occasions in the debate, estimates that 60 % of its clients were able to stabilise their financial position after a voluntary freezing of interest charges and enforcement action by their creditors, so it is clear that a breathing space scheme can make a real difference to the lives of people struggling with problem personal debt."", 'i completely agree with my hon. friend. the idea is that this is just a problem for a few hundred thousand people, but debt, worrying about debt and the causes of debt are mainstream concerns in this country. debt management, debt advice and the work of citizens advice is very important, but i also believe that, when we see these problems growing again, there is a role for us to step in before they get any worse. i made a call to action several years ago about payday lenders. we did not listen then until it was too late. i hope the government will listen now. we know that not everybody is struggling, and that britain is a nation of contrasts, where some people have seen their wealth balloon because of property and pension rights. however, we also know that there are too many for whom debt is just everyday life. it is debt on basic payments - on food, rent and travelling to work costs. we know that 25 % of the uk population now struggles with debt. not everybody is in trouble, but enough are, and the reason is the nature of the products they use to deal with their debt, particularly credit cards. i hope the minister will understand why we need to act, because credit cards are the acceptable face of modern debt for people. all of us have one ; i am sure if members were to open up their wallets and purses, they would have, if not one, then maybe two or three with them. there are 30 million cardholders in the united kingdom. indeed, the financial conduct authority has been investigating the credit card market.']"

sponsored acts of terrorism, it is surely right that the responsibility to represent the victims should be carried by the united kingdom government, whose duty must always be to defend the rights of british subjects. as chairman of the parliamentary support group established to help the victims of libyan -

the hon. and gallant gentleman - for that important contribution. over 3, 500 people died in the troubles over many decades. to quote the northern ireland affairs committee report of 2017 : a€œthere is no doubt that the weapons, funding, training, and explosives that colonel gaddafi provided to the provisional ira over the course of 25 years both extended and exacerbated the northern ireland troubles, and caused enormous human suffering. a€i want to read two further quotes. one is from the minister, who said : a€œthere is no lawful basis on which the uk could seize or change the ownership of any libyan assets. the un security council resolution under which those assets were frozen, which the uk supported, is clear that they should eventually be returned for the benefit of the libyan people. to breach that resolution would be a violation of international law. a€ - the second is from the hon. member for tewkesbury, the former chair of the northern ireland affairs committee, who said : a€œthe uk government cannot allow this litany of missed chances to continue. there needs to be direct dialogue with the libyan government, and if the situation there makes this impossible, the government must begin the process of establishing a fund themselves. a€i would be interested to hear the minister ' s comments. i want to make it clear that labour members - like, i am sure, members on both sides of the house - have nothing but sympathy and support for every single victim of ira terrorism, especially when much of that bloodshed was assisted by gaddafi ' s libyan regime. in conclusion, i would like to ask the minister a number of questions. first, is there incontrovertible evidence of the supply of up to 10 tonnes of semtex and more than 1, 000 rifles by the gaddafi regime to the ira?"", 'i congratulate the hon. member for tewkesbury ( mr robertson ) on securing this debate. i also thank every member who has contributed with such knowledge and such sympathy for the victims of ira bombings, especially those bombings that were supplied by explosives from libya. this afternoon we have heard many tragic and moving cases of victims who have still received no compensation, while they look around them and see other countries that have managed to obtain compensation for the victims of terror instigated by the libyan regime under colonel gaddafi. the hon. member for tewkesbury called on the government to compensate victims now. he referred to similar cases and the role of the libyan government in the ira terror campaign, and quoted the comments of the former labour foreign secretary, jack straw, on libyan - sponsored terror. my hon. friend the member for vauxhall ( kate hoey ) said quite clearly and accurately that this is not a party political issue, but it is one of justice. she told the house of a harrowing case. victims were told that this was a private matter, but she does not believe that and nor should we. the hon. member for south suffolk ( james cartlidge ) drew our attention to a 22 - year - old woman police officer who was killed in the 1983 bombing of harrods. a united states citizen was eventually compensated by libya for that same outrage. the hon. gentleman wants similar legislation to that which has now been passed by congress in the united states - the justice against sponsors of terrorism act. it will be interesting to hear what the minister says about that. we then heard from my hon. friend the member for jarrow ( mr hepburn ), who has been a member of the northern ireland affairs committee since 2004. he said that we must never forget the victims over so many years who are still suffering today. that was generally the theme of this debate.']"

we do not even have that north of the border. pregnancies for women with pku are extremely high risk. we have a slightly odd fail - first approach in this country, which can lead to serious defects and lifelong disabilities for children if they survive the pregnancy. the cost to the nhs of treating those disabilities over the life of the child is significantly more than the cost of kuvan for the mother during pregnancy. we have an odd approach to cost - effectiveness when looking at medicines in this country that i think we need to reassess. that is not only true for kuvan ; we have seen it when talking about orkambi and for various other issues.', 'i absolutely agree. i hope that one of the good things that will come out of this debate is that the buck stops being passed, and the assessment gets done as quickly as possible. it is so important for people to have access to this drug ; we need that to be sorted. there is evidence that for a significant proportion of people with pku - about 25 % - this drug can significantly improve their condition. it does not cure it, but it does make it much easier to deal with the dietary issues, which have such an impact on the way people live their lives. despite the drug having been around for so long, nhs england has only recently considered it for the management of pku. the drug has now been referred to nice for assessment and technology appraisal. the appg on pku recently heard from nice about the process, but there is concern about the timescales and how the benefits of the treatment will be assessed. understandably, there is huge frustration on the part of the pku community that there are children and adults who could be benefiting from kuvan now, and there is substantial evidence to support its benefits. there is a particular issue about prescribing kuvan for pregnant women with pku, who can understandably find it hugely difficult to control their diet, and who fear the effect of any problems on their unborn child. while there is a 2013 commissioning policy in place that allows kuvan to be prescribed to some pregnant women, it can be difficult for women to be prescribed it in a timely way. some people, some of whom are in this room, have had access to kuvan through individual funding requests, or on a trial basis. those people have found real benefits from the drug. my constituent archie, who is here, started on the treatment earlier this year.']"

by 2014, 99 % complied. when the then secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs gave evidence to the environmental audit committee ' s inquiry on the natural environment after the eu referendum, she told the committee that approximately a third of the more than 800 pieces of eu environmental legislation will be difficult to transpose into uk law. the committee also identified a considerable governance gap, which the government have acknowledged, and i support new clause 18, which would enshrine what the government have said they want in relation to carrying over environmental principles and establishing a new environmental regulatory body. my amendment addresses the substantial flaws, gaps and democratic deficit in the bill that were not addressed in committee, in particular to fully transpose current eu environmental legislation in all areas effectively into uk law to avoid any weakening or loss of existing environmental protection during brexit.""]"

more than any other competing nation and over 20 per cent of the medals available. a€that is even more than northern ireland!"", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the removal of shooting sports from birmingham 2022 commonwealth games. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr hanson. i would like to push forward with the efforts started by the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) - i am pleased to see him present - to make the case for the reinstatement of shooting sports at the 2022 commonwealth games in birmingham. i have picked up many of the points raised during his adjournment debate, and i will expand on them in the wake of the home nations ' phenomenal performance at the gold coast commonwealth games this year. the decision not to include shooting in the 2022 commonwealth games in birmingham has left many in the uk, particularly in my constituency, confused and unhappy. the matter is of particular importance to a constituent of mine, david mcmath, a 21 - year - old young man who recently won gold in the men ' s double trap competition at the games this year. he set a games record with a total of 74 - four ahead of his nearest rival, tim kneale from the isle of man, who took silver. without a doubt, shooting is a source of extreme national pride for the home nations of the united kingdom, as it is one of our strongest sports. in fact, we are the second strongest group in shooting events and managed to collect 38 % of the medals on offer this year. not adding shooting to the 2022 games has taken away 57 medal opportunities. every one of the home nations and channel islands participated in the shooting events, which proves the sport ' s popularity. in fact, it was the only sport for which the isle of man won a medal this year."", 'the hon. gentleman makes very good points and i agree with him. manchester used bisley in 2002, although it is 215 miles from the shooting ground. i therefore argue that it can be done and that bisley can provide the required facilities. i concede that bisley is not in tip - top condition, but the venue remains fully operational and would require only light modernisation to bring it up to scratch. with 95 % of the competition venues already in place, minor refurbishment of the bisley shooting ground would not add an unfeasible workload to the games organisers. a second solution is to build a new site alongside the new national shooting centre for which uk sport and british shooting are currently securing funding and planning permission. if the organisers of the birmingham games were to link funding to the national governing body, it would be a fantastic opportunity to ensure that the games leave a lasting legacy. shooting is currently on a list of optional sports, from which the host city must choose seven. the organisers of birmingham 2022 have opted to include table tennis, for which england has only ever won 15 medals. that pales in comparison with the 168 medals won for shooting. they have also opted for 3x3 basketball, which is a novelty in the commonwealth games. i think shooting is a more important sport. given that i have just presented a counter - argument and an alternative option to the venue issue cited by the birmingham organisers, i see no logical reason why england would want to cheat herself of a significant number of medals by removing shooting from the agenda. shooting has been on the commonwealth games agenda at every games bar 1970. it was originally introduced in 1966 and, as my hon. friend the member for wyre forest ( mark garnier ) has said, it is one of the most diverse and inclusive sports on offer.']"

only a small number live in that very important community - and convincing him to leave because the back windows had dirt coming in and he was at risk of being crushed if he stayed in his own home. as the hon. member for angus mentioned, there are challenges in dealing with insurance companies. there is no doubt that we have significant challenges in coastal erosion the length and breadth of scotland and beyond, and it is vital that all the governments of the uk work together. i want to set the record straight on what the scottish government have done. i hope the hon. lady will be aware of the a£42 million a year that the scottish government have made available via the capital settlement since 2008 - that is, a£420 million - to enable local authorities to invest in flood prevention and coastal erosion works.', 'i thank my hon. friend for his intervention and i absolutely agree. there are huge studies going on in my constituency as well, because we need to do the groundwork, but we also need to have the funding ready for when those studies complete, so that we can go ahead with the work that needs to be done. of course, when it comes to coastal erosion, the waves do not respect local authority boundaries. erosion affects areas up and down the coastline and different local authorities face common and related problems. this is not something that should be left to local authorities alone ; there is space for a much more joined - up approach to erosion at all levels of government. however, such action must also be timely. i do not want to see montrose ending up as a cautionary tale for other parts of the coastline. unfortunately, the scottish government are risking that happening by leaving the implementation of further solutions to the 2022 to 2028 six - year plan for flood risk management. angus cannot wait until 2022, or until any time between 2022 and 2028. even by 2022, swathes of the angus coastline will have been lost. the risk of flooding and erosion to montrose, arbroath and other coastal communities in angus will be even more serious than it is today, and existing defences are being put under increasing and unbearable strain. it is the responsibility of local authorities, the devolved administrations and the uk government alike to start working together on the issue as a matter of urgency, so that we can quite literally hold back the tide that threatens so many of our coastal communities. the government are due to publish their updated national flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy next year, and within that i ask the minister to consider ways to make that work happen, ensuring that everyone involved in protecting our coasts around the whole uk is working effectively together.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered coastal erosion. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir david. the future of britain ' s coastline, and of our coastal communities, is finally getting the political attention that it deserves - not a moment too soon. from the need to curb plastic waste to prevent environmental damage to our shores to the opportunities that brexit presents for reviving our long - struggling fishing communities, britain ' s coasts are coming to the forefront of the political agenda. i am glad, because if our coastal communities are to benefit from this renewed focus on their future, we need to act now to ensure that they have a future. coastal erosion threatens large parts of britain ' s coasts and puts houses, businesses and entire communities at risk of flooding or, in some cases, total destruction. many hon. members will be familiar with this issue, as coastal erosion threatens about 17 % of the uk ' s coastline, specifically along the east coast. the environment agency estimates that more than 700 properties in england could be lost to coastal erosion by the 2030s, while in scotland, erosion is believed to pose a risk to a fifth of the coastline and the erosion rate has doubled since the 1970s. in 2013 and 2014, storms and extreme tides caused erosion that experts believed would never happen, but it has happened, and even quicker than they thought as it occurred almost overnight. businesses and individuals are increasingly concerned about the impact of the increasingly rapid degradation of our coastline. our coasts are vital areas and hubs of economic activity. as well as the obvious tourism draws, they are home to much of our crucial infrastructure. in scotland, the soft coastline, which is about 19 % of the total, and which is most at risk, includes roads, railways and scotland ' s water network.""]"

case scenario. that reflects the very challenging operating environment in eastern drc, which is a heavily populated area affected by insecurity. for example, last weekend an attack by armed groups on a monusco base was close to where a vaccination team were staying. thankfully, none of the ebola responders was injured, but they were moved to goma for a short period and vaccination activities had to be paused for a day. the scale of the response is also challenging. in addition to the 373 confirmed and probable cases, the drc government, supported by who and other implementing partners, is trying to trace some 4, 400 contacts on a daily basis. however, there is some encouraging news. the response is enabling faster detection of cases, laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of the spread of the disease.', ""first, i thank the minister for giving me advance sight of her statement. i share the government ' s deep concern about the outbreak of ebola in the democratic republic of the congo, and i am pleased to hear that a£25 million of uk aid has been given to the response. we hope that it goes some way to containing this deadly outbreak. in addition, supporting neighbouring countries to prepare to tackle the disease is fundamental and welcome. in 2014, we learned the hard way what happens when action is not taken fast enough to halt the cruel and deadly ebola virus. we all remember with great sadness how too many people tragically lost their lives in west africa, and none of us will ever forget the fear and chaos that the virus wreaked on the affected communities, and indeed right across the globe. i am sure we all agree that we must act now to avoid a repeat of those horrific scenes, and help the drc to contain this outbreak. with the world health organisation reporting that 213 people have died since 1 august in the drc, and the humanitarian agency ma©decins sans frontia¨res confirming 366 cases, let us be sure that dfid steps up and ensures that the uk plays a crucial leadership role alongside the international community in responding to this outbreak, just as we did in sierra leone four years ago. however, while emergency humanitarian response is an integral part of dfid ' s work, i am sure the minister agrees that prevention is better than emergency response. while we send aid to drc, we cannot and must not turn our backs on providing the long - term support that will ensure countries across the global south have appropriate health systems set up in the first place. it is deeply disappointing, therefore, that the minister ' s department dropped health spending from 18 % of dfid spend in 2014, to 12 % in 2017."", 'i will come on to the lessons learnt since the outbreak in sierra leone in a moment. however, i am sure that i cannot possibly have heard from the opposition front bench a statement to the effect that having a strong private sector is somehow in conflict with having the revenues needed to provide strong health systems around the world. i hope that that is not the considered position of those on the labour front bench. while spending on strengthening health systems around the world, particularly in some of the poorest and most fragile affected countries, it is important that we in the uk recognise the important role of growth and job creation in the ability of those countries to generate their own tax revenues so that they can continue to strengthen their own health systems. we think that that is the most important way to approach worldwide development. i digress from the topic at hand. the hon. lady mentions the outbreak in west africa. i draw the attention of the house to progress and lessons that have been learned since that outbreak. first, the importance of reacting quickly has been taken into account, both in the first outbreak in the drc earlier this year, which i am glad to say has been brought under control, and in this outbreak. importantly, the uk has ensured that the who has the resources it needs as soon as it needs them, because this is a clear case of where a quick reaction will save lives. one major milestone that has occurred since the outbreak in west africa is that the world has developed an experimental vaccine, which was deployed for the first time this year in the drc. it proved to be effective in the first outbreak. as i said, 31, 000 people have been given the experimental vaccine so far in this outbreak. one real challenge, however, is that this outbreak is in a conflict - affected area.']"

it does not apply to the other sites under hes contractual arrangements with the trust. the hon. gentleman asked whether the waste was being secured safely. the answer is yes ; the environment agency has been inspecting the situation. the issue is the overstorage of waste, not that the waste is not being stored in a safe manner. well, that is the legal remit of the environment agency, which is an independent body.', ""as i set out in the written statement published this morning, on 31 july the environment agency notified central government of an issue concerning clinical waste disposal. the primary concern was that too much waste was being held by a contractor, healthcare environment services, in a number of waste storage and treatment sites. this included waste collected from hospitals and other public services. although the waste was stored securely, it was not being disposed of within the correct regulatory timescales. the department of health and social care, the nhs, the department for environment, food and rural affairs, the environment agency and the cabinet office have worked together to resolve the issues. our priority throughout has been to ensure that proper measures were put in place to enable trusts to continue to operate as normal. a major part of the contingency plans concerned commercially sensitive contractual discussions with hes and other providers. following the environment agency ' s partial suspension of hes ' s normanton site, which came into force on 3 october 2018, nhs improvement wrote to hes to raise its concerns. nhsi gave hes an opportunity to set out how it was complying with its legal and contractual obligations ; hes failed to provide that assurance. as a result, 15 nhs trusts served contract termination notices on sunday 7 october. as part of our contingency arrangements, we ran a tender process with the clinical waste sector before awarding a new contract to mitie. as contracts with hes were terminated over the weekend, mitie stepped in and, from monday morning, provided continuing waste collection and incineration across all of these organisations. in september, officials from the department of health and social care visited each of the major trauma centres affected and confirmed that waste was being stored correctly and that contingency plans were in place. in addition, visits have been undertaken to each of the sites by the environment agency this weekend and this week, alongside earlier visits.""]"

informed debate, and i am grateful to the right hon. member for arundel and south downs for his tremendous summary and history of the issue. i have a bit more history for the house. first, though, i would like to give the scottish picture. tb levels in scotland are relatively stable and low. it accounts for between eight and nine cases per 100, 000 of the population and is a contributing factor in about 40 deaths a year - although any death is a death too many. archaeological records show signs of tuberculosis in the remains of ancient mummies, and on this very day 689 years ago, robert the bruce, king of scots, is alleged to have died of tuberculosis. tb has killed more people than any other disease in history. the modern scottish government are playing their part in tackling global challenges, including epidemics and health inequalities. since 2005, the scottish government have committed at least a£3 million a year towards funding international development work. this was initially focused on malawi to reflect 150 years of collaborative development between our two countries. in 2017, that was increased to a£10 million a year. tb is a major public health problem in malawi, and multi - drug - resistant tb is an emerging issue. as mentioned, there is also a significant link between tb and hiv, with more than half the cases in malawi being infected with both.', ""i strongly agree with the hon. gentleman that the diseases must be treated together. however, great progress has been made on tackling aids, partly because of the tremendous new tools available. by comparison, less progress has been made on tuberculosis. last year, 1. 7 million people died of tuberculosis. that is more than aids and malaria combined. the single fact that most people do not realise is that tuberculosis is now the world ' s deadliest infectious disease, and it deserves more attention than it gets. some 10 million people globally are falling ill each year as a result of this disease. tb was declared a global health emergency by the world health organisation 24 years ago. since then, 54 million people have died. that is not a great advert for the declaration of a global health emergency. three years ago in new york, the world ' s leaders set the sustainable development goals. target 3. 3 was to eliminate these major epidemics in 15 years. at the current trajectory, tb will not be eliminated for 160 years, so another 28 million people will die in the sustainable development goal period alone, costing the world economy $ 1 trillion cumulatively. middle and lower - income countries will be the most severely hit, with lower - income countries experiencing a reduction of something like 2 % of their gdp. on top of this, there are new threats. i mentioned that tb strikes when immune systems are compromised, and they can be compromised in new ways, including by the acquisition of diabetes. in indonesia, tb is striking people with diabetes, which is a growing problem. above all - this should concern the house greatly - is the growing risk of drug resistance. tb is the only major drug resistant infection that is transmitted through the air. it is already responsible for one in three deaths worldwide from all forms of drug resistance.""]"

operation is therefore actively supporting business and tourism by removing a barrier to people ' s life choices. arguably the greatest beneficiaries of these arrangements are our citizens who live on the continent, many of whom are enjoying their golden years in the sun. the framework put in place by the bill will ensure that the secretary of state has the necessary power to maintain or negotiate arrangements in any brexit eventuality. one of my constituents recently emphasised the importance of having these arrangements. his grandmother, who is now over 80, lives alone in france. a few years ago, she had a car accident that left her seriously injured. she required an operation and spent over a month in hospital. that was followed up by time in a convalescent home. all that care would have cost a small fortune but, luckily for her, she enjoys healthcare under the european health insurance card s1 route. access to that is fundamental to her and to the other 190, 000 pensioners like her, particularly as their health needs may increase over time. the bill should calm the anxieties of our citizens abroad. it will also save the taxpayer money."", 'i am grateful for this opportunity to close the debate on behalf of labour. it is clear that members on both sides of the house understand the importance of the bill. the uk currently enjoys reciprocal agreements for the provision of healthcare with all the nations of the european union. under existing arrangements, the healthcare of 190, 000 uk state pensioners living abroad - principally in ireland, spain, france and cyprus - and their dependent relatives is protected. in addition, uk residents who visit the eu or the european economic area on holiday or to study may use the european health insurance card to access healthcare for emergency treatment and healthcare needs that arise during their stay. anyone who is ordinarily resident in the uk qualifies for an ehic and 250, 000 claims for medical treatment are made each year under this scheme. by the same token, eu nationals visiting the uk can use their ehic to receive free care from the nhs for any emergency healthcare needs and for healthcare needs that arise during their stay. i am grateful to the hon. member for chelmsford ( vicky ford ) for reminding the house that the card does not cover repatriation and other associated expenses, but visitors to the eu can currently be reassured that their immediate emergency costs will be met. that is something that we would seek to protect. by means of the s1 form and the ehic, current arrangements also provide for the healthcare of employees of uk companies and organisations working in the eu and the eea, as well as for that of frontier workers living there, and vice versa. importantly, the agreement also provides funding for uk residents to travel overseas to receive planned treatment in other countries -

led forum the spotlight was on skills and on the barriers that prevent businesses recruiting people. it particularly looked at the barriers around the skills and training programmes in essex and the demands and challenges for the future workforce who are being trained. we need highly trained people, but the lack of flexibility within the training and provider landscape was clearly on display in the discussions that we had.', 'i beg to move, that this house has considered skills devolution in england. what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, mr bailey. i hope to have the pleasure of hearing your speech later. i am grateful to the backbench business committee for granting this debate on skills devolution in england. i am especially grateful to the members here from outside london, as i am keen to hear about the reality in their constituency regarding how we can tackle the national skills gap as flexibly as possible. across our country, we face an enormous challenge in ensuring that we have the skills that we need to operate the economy, and that we are doing all we can to enable people to secure such skills, and support them in doing so. the issue is particularly acute in london, where my constituency is, but it also exists in the larger cities throughout the country and, indeed, in the regions, and the situation has worsened since 2010, when further education colleges faced cuts -

changing climate. to give some background on how serious the situation is, the skills for life survey in 2011 reported that 43 % of people were found to have literacy skills below level 2 - a good pass at gcse - and 78 % had numeracy skills below that level. of the respondents, 15 % were found to have the literacy skills of an 11 - year - old or lower - an estimated 5 million people - and 49 % were at that level for numeracy. therefore, it is estimated that 17 million people have the numeracy skills of an 11 - year - old or lower. according to a 2017 lloyds bank report, 11. 5 million people in the uk are classified as not having basic digital skills. however, increasing numbers of young people are now leaving compulsory education with good standards of english and maths. in 2016, just over 71 % of 19 -

in other words, spitting alone - can constitute a common assault. that is true of the criminal justice act 1988, and spitting at an emergency worker of any kind should constitute an assault under this bill. my other amendment - amendment 3 - relates to sexual assault. the major part of the bill introduces an aggravated offence ; that is to say that the bill lists a series of different offences that, when perpetrated against an emergency worker, will be considered to be aggravated. when i drew up the bill, i was primarily thinking of physical violence towards emergency workers. but the truth is that, since i have been working on the bill, my hon. friend the member for halifax and i have received lots of representations, particularly from health service workers, about the sexual assault of ambulance workers, nurses, mental health nurses, doctors and others. one difficulty, both for the government and for us, has been that these statistics have never been gathered by nhs protect, which no longer exists anyway. however, the numbers of such incidents reported by the trade unions working on this matter are quite dramatic, particularly given that the figures show increases. since 2012, such incidents are up 143 % in the east of england ambulance service ; up 40 % in london ; up 133 % in the north west ambulance service ; and up 1500 % in northern ireland.', 'there are two aspects to the bill. the first is the offence of common assault, which i think is now drawn in such a way that the courts will be able to circumvent some of the arguments that have thus far been used to prevent any kind of successful prosecution. the second aspect relates to the aggravated offence, and the hon. gentleman is absolutely right that we have not included every single offence in the world. if amendment 3 is accepted this morning, i think that we will have included all offences that could relate to emergency workers. the minister was right to say that it is important that we take cognisance of the fact that, with this bill, we are saying that emergency workers are going to be treated slightly differently in law from the rest of the wider public. it is not that i want to create great hierarchies in society, with some people being more important than others ; it is that emergency workers are suffering these attacks and assaults because they are emergency workers, and that places a greater onus on us to ensure that they have the protections that they need. i return to amendment 2 and the question of whether spitting is common assault. the sentencing council has in recent years looked at whether spitting increases the culpability and seriousness of the offence, and it removed spitting from each of those categories in 2012. quite a lot of magistrates and judges have now started to say that this is one of the primary reasons that there has been a deflation in the number of successful prosecutions and in the sentences that are handed down. i regret the fact that spitting was removed by the sentencing council and hope that it will revisit that decision in the near future. i hope that the minister might also be able to say something about how we can ensure that the courts take spitting seriously as a part of common assault offences.', ""absolutely. in return for the hon. gentleman ' s sense and solidarity in not pressing the amendment, we will focus on making sure that the relevant authorities, particularly the cps, are clearly instructed to consider spitting as included under common assault. i hope that in a small way this speech in the house of commons will re - emphasise, in case anyone is in any doubt, that it is parliament ' s intention that spitting should always be included within the offence of common assault. that brings us to the amendment and various new clauses tabled by my hon. friend the member for shipley, which would further increase the penalty for assaulting emergency workers, police officers and prison officers. this is a complex set of new clauses. new clauses 1 and 2 relate to the existing law - in particular the police act 1996, as it relates to a police officer in the execution of their duty - and seek to do two things. the first is to increase the maximum penalty from six months to 12 months. on that, we respectfully argue that if the bill passes today, we will have already increased to 12 months the maximum penalty for such an assault on a police officer in the exercise of their functions. it would therefore be unnecessary to further amend the police act. the aim of new clause 2 and amendment 9 is to double the maximum penalty from 12 months to 24 months either by amending the police act or dealing with the criminal justice act 2003. the government wish to resist this approach because we have to weigh up two principles. on the one hand, we believe very strongly that emergency workers are entitled to a particular form of respect and protection because they work on our behalf - they provide services to us ; they represent us.""]"

will the minister tell me if any geothermal projects have been awarded to contracts for difference during either of the allocation rounds to date? there are mature geothermal renewable technologies providing heat and electricity that should and must play their part in the decarbonisation of our energy networks.""]"

conservative government with a majority of 80 - a government who were able to deliver very significant advances on these issues. my party has proudly continued with those advances, and last year the government committed to launching a consultation on reforming the gender recognition act 2004, as recommended by the women and equality committee ' s 2016 transgender equality inquiry. indeed, earlier today, the minister for women and equalities recommitted to launching this consultation - soon. in the hands of the civil service, a€œsoona€ is a somewhat elastic concept, as the minister will know. i would be grateful to her if she did a little better than that in replying to this debate, because every delay means people not being able to exercise the rights and choices they would ideally like to make. the gender recognition act enabled trans people, for the first time, to have their gender identity recognised under the law, which in 2004 was a very significant step forward for trans equality. today, however, the act is outdated and in urgent need of reform, and i commend the government ' s commitment to de - medicalise and streamline the process of legal gender recognition. in its present form, the act treats being trans as a mental illness by requiring applicants to have a psychiatric diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which is all too similar to what was thought about being gay and bi in the not too distant past."", 'i beg to move, that this house has considered proposals to allow self -

definition of gender is already happening. organisations seem to be ahead of the law, which the government may or may not be about to change. there is a particular concern about what is going on in schools with children.', ""i am sure the hon. gentleman ' s comments will slightly reassure the transgender community. the uk ' s legislation is so out of date that we are no longer considered a world leader on lgbt + rights. we were once no. 1 - right at the very top. we slipped to third, and we are fourth in this year ' s rankings. the international lesbian and gay association ' s a€œrainbow europe indexa€ report cites a surge in transphobic media coverage as the reason for our falling down that league table. the labour party has a proud record of championing equal rights, including lgbt + rights. it was a labour government who brought in the equality act 2010 and the gender recognition act 2004, and who abolished section 28 and created civil partnerships. we need to recognise that lgbt + people still face widespread discrimination, and it is clear that we must do more to enhance their rights and protections. the gender recognition act 2004 is now out of date and needs amending. the issue is about changing sex and gender on birth certificates, and we should talk about the facts. apart from birth certificates, it is already possible to change one ' s name, title and gender marker on all uk identity documents. that has been working well for more than 40 years. in fact, most trans people do not want to go through the indignity of applying for a gender recognition certificate. the government will have the support of opposition members to amend the gender recognition act 2004. i will go through a few more facts. deliberately making a false statutory declaration is a serious crime and is punishable by imprisonment. from the heartfelt contributions that we have heard, we know that changing one ' s gender is not done lightly. reform of the gender recognition act 2004 does not affect access to single - sex services and facilities, which has been made clear.""]"

party parliamentary china group, i congratulate others for joining in the debate and for expressing our concern about human rights, democracy and individual freedoms. as we reflect on the past 20 years, it is important to pay tribute to the hong kong government for the significant steps forward they have taken since handover, from minimum wage legislation to anti - corruption drives, clean water initiatives and huge investments in public infrastructure projects. as we look forward to the next 20 years, we should pause to remember the past 20, and how important the principles of the joint declaration are for the flourishing of hong kong ' s economy and society. the dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit of the hong kong people has allowed hong kong to flourish under the joint declaration. there is no reason why that should not continue. the uk - hong kong relationship has deepened. more than 600 uk businesses with registered offices in hong kong, an export market worth a£8. 6 billion and a uk investment stake of more than a£33 billion are clear signs that trade is booming. in terms of academic and cultural exchange, more hong kong students are enrolling at uk universities than ever before, which is an achievement to celebrate. in part, the relationships we form with students, young people and young democrats redouble our efforts to commit ourselves to a more socially just society based on individual freedoms and human rights. we are all aware of the high -

14 to 2015 - 16, and the subsequent freeze on the majority of social security payments, have caused low - income households to suffer a significant deterioration in the adequacy of social security support. the freeze to payments and support is having a detrimental impact on millions of people on low incomes across the uk. inflation has more than doubled in the past year. it hit 3. 1 % in november, and it is now at 2. 7 %."", ""i will try to be brief. i am bewildered about what this debate is supposed to achieve. the hon. member for ayr, carrick and cumnock ( bill grant ) agreed with many of the points we put to him -

mhra - uses that name, i will use it to cover all five of them collectively. originally, isotretinoin was marketed as a chemotherapy drug. based on the evidence of friends who have undergone chemotherapy, i am immediately warned to watch out for side effects. i do not suffer any more from teenage acne or have the urgent need to get it under control that could easily make me overcome misgivings in a bid to get rid of such a curse. the effects of isotretinoin were last debated on 3 december 2013 in this very place. i took part in that debate because i was concerned to hear about the effects of isotretinoin on the nephew of one of my then constituents. worries about the effects of isotretinoin had been debated in parliament some 10 years before that. this seems to be a problem that will not go away and for which we have no scientifically based answer. i was spurred to call this debate by a constituent who prefers to remain anonymous, but whose son - a totally happy young man - has had his life totally disrupted since taking isotretinoin for severe acne.', 'i too was expecting to come later in the order of speeches - christmas has come early for me. happy christmas to everyone, and thank you to all the staff who run this place. i have said that now, so i will not repeat it. i want to raise the subject of the danger caused by a drug called isotretinoin, which i have already spoken about - perhaps four times - in the house since becoming an mp. to date, i have to say, the collective view of the house has had little impact on actually sorting it out. isotretinoin, also known as accutane or roaccutane, is a drug used to treat severe acne primarily in teenagers - mainly boys. it has dramatic effects : it clears acne up pretty quickly, but its side - effects can be enormous. it can cause severe depression and impotence in those who use it. my concerns stem from contact with constituents, particularly one lady. she is the mother of a young man who has suffered enormously from isotretinoin. at the age of 16, he was given the drug for eight months. as a result, he suffered - forgive my language - complete erectile dysfunction, which has had a life - changing effect on him and, indeed, on his mental state. he is now in his early 20s, and it has of course had a dramatic effect on him. he has been through university, too. unsurprisingly, his mother is distraught, in particular because her son is now almost unwilling even to discuss the matter. i believe that we can all understand that. it must be very difficult for a young man to discuss such a matter with his mother. i, personally - i know i am from another generation - could not even have dreamt of talking about such a matter with my mother.']"

it must be separate from the nhs to ensure real independence, and it must investigate and act on concerns. if a local investigation has failed or is failing, there should be a mechanism to report that to an independent body. if we get to the point where there is simply a slanging match within a trust, there will never be a satisfactory resolution, so arbitration needs to come in and look at the cold facts and the original facts of the disclosure. often, what is looked at is the process, but not whether the whistleblower was actually right to raise an issue in the first place. it is critical that whistleblowers are protected from detriment from the moment of speaking up. they should be protected during the investigation, and they must not be picked on either subtly, as the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) said, or blatantly - they must not lose their jobs. it is important that legal penalties for reprisals against whistleblowers can actually be enforced. there should be a system of redress for whistleblowers that does not involve litigation. litigation is expensive for the nhs and the whistleblower, and is utterly confrontational.']"

when will sir charles godfray ' s review of the government ' s tb policy be published? will it consider the use of vaccination as an alternative to shooting? some horrific video footage has been obtained from the badger cull area in cumbria. a caged badger was shot and took almost a minute to die, writhing in agony. the shooter then flagrantly disregarded the biosecurity guidelines, took the badger out of the cage and failed to bag it up - little wonder that the government ' s policy has not been particularly successful in reducing the spread of tb."", ""i am disappointed that the minister did not give way at the end. i think it is very unfair to characterise the situation as being the fault of the previous labour government. let us remember that it was the previous labour government who - rather controversially - actually backed the randomised badger cull tests from which the conclusion was drawn that the way to tackle bovine tb was not through a badger cull. i repeat that the body of evidence from the scientists involved in the randomised badger cull tests showed that carrying on with the badger cull could have made matters worse. we have seen over the last five years of this horrific cull, which continues, that, even putting the appalling cruelty to one side, it is simply not working. it is all very well for the minister to get up and say that various peer - reviewed reports have implied that it has worked, but the evidence speaks for itself. how can the minister stand there and say that it has worked when the proportion of tb in cattle herds is virtually the same as at the start of the cull, and when it has even spread to other areas? the government are looking in the wrong direction. i heard what the minister said, but i implore him to go back and look again at pursuing a different route, at the cattle movements, at the fraud that takes place, at biosecurity and at doing proper testing and supporting farmers in doing so, rather than expecting them to stump up for the bill. this is an appalling state of affairs. i repeat that there is no scientific evidence to support the government ' s position. public opinion is overwhelmingly opposed to the badger cull, which does not serve the farming community in any way, shape or form and certainly does not serve the interests of wildlife in our country.""]"

this is about multitasking and ensuring that we reflect the whole economy and women ' s contributions to it. we know, for example, that the lowest - paid women tend to feature in four industries : retail, childcare, caring and cleaning. we are looking at those sectors to ensure that the figures for the gender pay gap translate into real - life policies that have the greatest impact for the lowest - paid women. the shadow minister mentioned some figures quoted by the oecd. she will have to forgive me - obviously i am doing this on my feet - but just to put them in context, we understand that the oecd figures use a different methodology and go much wider than our gender pay gap measures. we are working with colleagues across whitehall to increase women ' s economic empowerment. in terms of government recruitment, those factors are very much taken into account when we look at contracts. i hope that reassures her. i turn now to the drivers of the gender pay gap."", 'i will do my best, sir david. i thank you for calling me, and i congratulate the hon. member for redditch ( rachel maclean ) on securing this debate. it is a particular honour to speak on this important subject in the year of the 100th anniversary of women gaining the right to vote. while we celebrate the advancement of women in society, politics, and the workplace, we must also reflect on progress that still needs to be made, because especially in the workplace, women do not have parity with their male counterparts. there are many reasons why women have not secured the great progress that we deserve in recent years. i will try to address as many of those reasons as possible, and set out why i believe the government have a duty to take action. the first and most obvious disparity is pay. the office for national statistics found that men earn, on average, nearly 20 % more than women, and 48 years after labour passed the equal pay act 1970, men are still paid substantially more than their female counterparts. those figures are simply unacceptable. the gender pay gap exposes the multitude of barriers and other daily challenges that women face in the workplace. women are unlikely to progress up the career ladder at the same speed as men. employers may discriminate against women when recruiting due to the maternity leave they may take in future, and research published today by the equality and human rights commission states that six in 10 employers - 59 % - agree that a woman should disclose whether she is pregnant during the recruitment process. that is unacceptable ; that is not what we are fighting for. as a single mother i have experienced at first hand the enormous challenge of juggling parenthood with a sustainable career. with two young children at primary school, the only work available to me was in retail, and i met many single mothers in that position who were struggling on low pay.', ""i am actually more ambitious than the hon. lady. i do not just want to impose regulations on business ; i want a change in the culture of business, a change in the culture of the public sector where we know there are gender pay gaps, and a change in the culture of schools and universities. this cannot be imposed from the top down ; it must be driven with enthusiasm by the organisations themselves. i hope that this will empower women to begin asking very difficult questions of their employers. i would like women to begin thinking about this when they apply for jobs. they should look at the gender pay gap and make decisions about how that shows how that employer treats their female workforce. the hon. lady mentioned the number of companies in the government ' s first estimate. this is just the first year. this was always going to be a bit of a learning exercise not just for the government, but for businesses and the way they manage the system. we are delighted that there are more companies than we initially estimated that meet the criteria. as she knows, the criteria cover businesses that employ 250 or more people, which means big, successful businesses. we are delighted that there are more of those than our initial estimates suggested. i am very pleased that we have the support of the shadow front - bench team in our common ambition to help women in the workplace to get a fairer deal. of course we must always seek to do better - and we must use the data to improve the way in which women are treated - but i am pleased to note that we have more women in employment than ever before and, what is more, the full - time gender pay gap is at a record low of 9. 1 % - that is 9. 1 % too high, but it is at a record low, and it is on a downward trajectory. i am sure that we all support that in this house.""]"

we have got to get it right in our own hospitals and across the nhs and the whole united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland, and then we can look further afield to other countries. he reminds me that last year i had occasion to be in hospital three times for various operations. i never had any infections. i had nothing but the best care. the surgeon ' s knife went in the right direction and removed what had to removed. it was important to do that. the important thing is that we have hospitals and an nhs that are excellent. when the nhs works well, it is the best in the world, but sometimes we need to think about things. the cost of infections to the nhs includes the immediate costs of treating patients in hospital, bed - blocking and so on. there are also issues with hospital capacity, which has reached 100 % in some cases. the world health organisation estimates that 50 % to 70 % of hospital - acquired infections are transmitted by hands, so improving hand hygiene must play a central role in any strategy to reduce hospital infections. it would be remiss of me not to note the work carried out by the secretary of state to improve patient safety in the nhs - let us give credit where credit is due. in november 2016, there was a commitment to halve gram - negative infections by 2020. the secretary of state announced he would appoint a new national infection prevention lead, dr ruth may. both are important steps in bringing down infection rates and show a commitment to do so. given that 50 % to 70 % of hospital infections are transmitted by hands, i was encouraged to see alongside those measures a commitment for the nhs to publish staff hand hygiene indicators for the first time."", 'i beg to move, that this house has considered raising standards of infection prevention and control in the nhs. this issue has been brought to my attention by a number of health organisations, and by lobby groups within the house as well. we are very aware that 5 may marked world hand hygiene day and i am very glad to have secured this debate, to draw attention to the importance of infection prevention and control in the nhs and, in particular, the role of good hand hygiene in raising standards. the first time the matter came to my attention was when my brother keith had a serious motorbike accident some 12 years ago. whenever we visited him in the royal victoria hospital, we were told by the nurses to wash our hands : a€œeverything has to be very, very hygienic in here. a€ we washed our hands almost to the point of obsession because in that ward people were between life and death, and infection could have meant the end of a life. this year, world hand hygiene day focused on raising awareness about sepsis. we all know about sepsis through our constituents and the stories in the press as well. the world health organisation estimates that sepsis affects some 30 million patients worldwide every year. in response to a business question that i put to the leader of the house, she suggested i seek a debate in westminster hall on the matter. as i am not very often here, i thought i would introduce a debate myself for a change - it would perhaps be an occasion. here in the uk, there are 44, 000 deaths from sepsis every year and it is a priority area for the secretary of state. effective hand hygiene plays a key role in reducing the risk of healthcare - associated infections such as e. coli, which are a major risk factor for developing sepsis.']"

terrorism approach and strengthen a variety of measures to respond to the terrorist threat, allowing earlier intervention to disrupt terrorism. i agree with the government ' s desire to intervene at an early stage. such intervention is not only effective in stopping terrorist attacks, but helpful in preventing young people from becoming radicalised. terrorist organisations are using 21st - century measures, including social media, to promote their propaganda as a means of radicalising youngsters. it is only right for the government to review their approach to ensure that it is fit for the 21st century and future -

although, mercifully, no one was killed in that final attack. it is fundamental that our approach in legislation does not undermine the very values that the terrorists seek to attack. the rule of law has to be fundamental to our approach. i am grateful for the consensual approach that the security minister has taken on the bill and the concessions he has made. the concession in respect of the three clicks in clause 3 makes it a better bill. the concession on clause 14 and the preservation of the right to peaceful protest is very important, too, and is very much a part of what he rightly said about protecting our own values as an open, liberal and tolerant democracy. i hope that this consensual approach can now continue into the lords. as i indicated in my speech on the first set of new clauses and amendments, i am concerned that the designated areas clause came so late, and we will therefore want to subject it to scrutiny.', 'i come to this debate wanting to be positive about attempts by the government to give our police and security forces the powers that they need in the fight against terrorism and to balance that with the equal priority of ensuring that we do not hit our civil liberties and therefore give the terrorists a victory. already we have heard how different aspects of this bill will be judged by those tests. no one who witnessed the horrors in london and manchester last year can be in any doubt that we need to redouble our efforts to protect the public. the evidence is clear, and the terrorist threat across the uk remains severe. with that threat morphing into a diverse range of threats, including people acting alone, and with the numbers involved increasing, if anything, the terrorist threat for our security forces and the police is probably the most difficult it has ever been. liberal democrats will not, at this early stage, seek to oppose this bill, but ministers and those watching this debate should not take that as agreement, in full or in part, to these proposed laws. we need to scrutinise the bill to make sure that we get the balance right. it is already clear from this debate that there are serious questions whether some of these proposed laws are necessary, whether they are properly based on sound evidence and whether there are sufficient safeguards to prevent their being abused against totally innocent citizens. the government may have a job in persuading this house and the other place that these measures should pass totally unamended in the form that we see them tonight. in considering yet another piece of terrorism legislation, the house should recall the opinion of the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, max hill, when he was appointed just over a year ago. he said that he thought that the uk had sufficient offences in the fight against terrorism and that we did not need any more.']"

i think, and our committee agrees - in a far too narrow way. the charity commission guidance for students unions indicated that it would consider it acceptable for charitable students unions to comment ona€œstreet lighting near the campusa€because the issue affects students as students, and therefore fulfils their charitable purposes. the charity commission would consider it unacceptable for students unions to comment publicly on issues that do not directly affect the welfare of students as students, such as, a€œthe treatment of political prisoners in a foreign country. a€that is the charity commission ' s own example, illustrating the point raised by my hon. friend the member for stafford. the minister told our committee that the charity commission guidance shoulda€œgo further and facilitate the promotion of free speech. it should be giving students ' unions the permission to host debates about controversial issues and expose students to a wide range of viewpoints. that should be the core purpose. a€that is quite right."", ""this inquiry is one of the most important that we have undertaken in my three years on the joint committee on human rights. as we have heard, we received some very disturbing evidence. free speech is indeed a foundation for democracy in society, and universities are places where many of tomorrow ' s leaders learn how to explore ideas in a way that prepares them to engage in and influence wider society, so it is critical that free speech is secured in universities. a key part of all students ' education is the ability to engage in dialogue and contentious debate. universities have a legal duty under the education act to secure freedom of speech within the law, both for students and for visiting speakers. if we do not prepare students to engage in dialogue in an environment that promotes free speech, there is a serious danger that we will risk promoting extremism and factionalism within wider society. only by understanding different views and beliefs and by, as one of our witnesses said, countering bad ideas with good ones, will we build community cohesion and break down prejudice and discrimination in wider society, which, at worst, as we know, can lead to violent disturbances within our local communities. that is something that none of us wants. indeed, it is one of the purposes of the prevent strategy. it is ironic that the strategy is in many ways defeating one of its key objectives in the way that it is applied at universities. i will come on to that in more detail shortly. for the record, i will set the legal scene, which the committee is now well versed in. article 9 of the european convention on human rights states that, a€œeveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion."", ""that is an excellent example. i hope it will also encourage students to the right of karl marx, because i have spoken to a number of students who have recently said, a€œi wouldn ' t admit to being a conservative on campus. a€our committee concluded that the concept of safe spaces, having been extended to entire university campuses, is unhelpful. it is not only unhelpful. if minority views are supressed across the whole campus, but they are not views that are promoting terrorism or inciting the kind of activity i referred to earlier, the concept is actually against the law, impinging on the right to free speech under article 10 of the european convention on human rights. a number of students unions tried to argue in evidence to us that it was necessary to limit speakers who cause harm through speech - harm caused because people might find speech disturbing or upsetting. as our report says, however, this is counter or detrimental to free speech. regarding safe spaces, we say : a€œwhilst there must be opportunities for genuinely sensitive and confidential discussions in university settings, and whilst the original intention behind safe space policies may have been to ensure that minority or vulnerable groups can feel secure, in practice the concept of safe spaces has proved problematic, often marginalising the views of minority groups. they need to co - exist with and respect free speech. they cannot cover the whole of the university or university life without impinging on rights to free speech... when that happens, people are moving from the need to have a a€œsafe spacea€ to seeking to prevent the free speech of those whose views they disagree with. minority groups or individuals holding unpopular opinions which are within the law should not be shut down nor be subject to undue additional scrutiny by students ' unions or universities.""]"

the promoters may not thank me for saying this - it should not be the case that, for example, the commissioners ' mates or one particular group end up finding themselves on the navigation advisory committee. however, the promoters were happy to accept the idea that relevant interests should be declared and that there should be clear processes for how that works."", ""i am pleased to respond on the opposition ' s behalf to this opposed private business. although it might not be the most conventional way to introduce legislative change, and i have heard the detailed reservations of the hon. member for christchurch ( sir christopher chope ), we are none the less satisfied that the bill makes sense, and our intention is to support the bill as it stands. although the bill is fairly narrow in scope, we acknowledge that it has important consequences for those who will be affected. we are satisfied that due scrutiny has taken place in committee and is taking place at consideration stage this afternoon. the middle level of the fens was first drained in the 17th century to reclaim an area of farmland in cambridgeshire and west norfolk. the middle level commissioners are the navigation authority for the waterways, established through a series of local acts passed between 1663 and 1874, so we appreciate that the legislative framework underpinning the role of the commissioners is in need of an update. this is not least because almost all the fenland within the middle level waterways is below sea level, and if it was not for a complex system of flood mitigation and drainage schemes managed by the commissioners, the waterways could pose a significant risk to the estimated 100, 000 people who live and work in the area. in the simplest terms, the bill will introduce a registration scheme for vessels in the middle level and allow the commissioners to bring in revenue from boat owners that will be used to improve the waterways. the environment agency, the canal and river trust and the broads authority all have similar powers in respect of their own navigations, so in many ways, the bill is long overdue in bringing the middle level into line with its neighbours."", ""members will be pleased to know that i can be relatively brief. the government support the bill, which is promoted by the middle level commissioners, a statutory corporation constituted under the middle level act 1862. we have had a good debate this evening and i commend the many probing amendments that my hon. friend the member for christchurch ( sir christopher chope ) tabled, but i believe that all the points he raised have been dealt with comprehensively, in particular by my hon. friend the member for torbay ( kevin foster ), who has a deep grasp of all the detail of the bill. the legal framework that governs the commissioners ' navigation function is made up of a number of 18th and 19th century acts, which are now considerably out of date and do not align with modern requirements or the statutory framework that is applicable to other navigation authorities. in particular, the current legal framework that governs the commissioners does not include adequate provision for the registration of vessels using the waterways or the levying of charges for the use of the waterways and associated facilities. as a result, the commissioners do not receive any income from the navigation of the waterways, which has meant that moneys raised through drainage rates and levies have had to be used to fund navigation rather than for flood defence purposes, which is contrary to government policy. the commissioners are therefore seeking to update and clarify their powers to enable them to properly regulate and fund their waterways. the powers that they are seeking are similar to those used by other large inland navigation authorities, for example the canal and river trust, the environment agency and the broads authority. i very much support the bill and hope that it will pass unamended this evening.""]"

it is worth noting at this point that the government have in many ways been very supportive of cornwall in recent times. we are seeing record levels of investment in our transport infrastructure, and cornwall remains the only rural county to have been given a devolution deal by the government. however, when it comes to the specific matter of recognition of the cornish as a people, there is still a great deal to do."", ""i am grateful to my cornish colleague for that intervention and for pointing out the hon. member for wycombe, who in fact attended the same school as me in cornwall, so we have a great deal in common. he makes a very good point. this is not just about people currently living in cornwall ; it is about the right and opportunity for people across the country who count themselves cornish - maybe by birth ; maybe by ancestry - to identify themselves as cornish. the point has been made that there is the option under a€œothera€ in the census to write a€œcornisha€ as one ' s nationality. in fact, in 2011 a staggering 73, 000 cornish men and women chose to do so. i should declare an interest in saying that i was one of those 73, 000 people. an interesting comparison is worth noting. those 73, 000 people represent about 14 % of the residents of cornwall. that is the same percentage of welsh residents who wrote a€œwelsha€ under the a€œothera€ option in the 2001 census. in 2001, the inclusion of a specific tick box for a€œwelsha€ increased the percentage of people identifying as welsh from 14 % to 66 %. i am convinced that if a tick box was provided, we would see a similar increase in the percentage of people choosing cornish as their identity. a dropdown menu provision for a€œothera€ is not good enough. recognition by way of a tick box will not only satisfy those of us in the far west but enhance the accuracy of the census by allowing the many thousands of cornish men and women from across the uk - the cornish diaspora - to know that they can declare their cornish identity. gleaning accurate data is surely what the census is all about."", 'i am deeply honoured to be able to make the case tonight for celebrating cornish identity and to call for the inclusion of cornish identity to be recognised in the next census in 2021. i am very grateful for the support of many of my cornish colleagues here in the house this evening. there is no doubt or debate over the fact that the cornish are a proud people who share an extraordinary history that can be traced back thousands of years. in calling for this debate to make the case for a cornish tick box for national identity in the next census, there is a risk that some may see this as some sort of gimmick designed simply to boost our tourist industry or play into a stereotype of cornish country folk. nothing could be further from the truth. although it is true to say that many of us cornish can be guilty of having a playful jibe at the english, especially those from devon - after all they do put their jam and cream on the wrong way round on their scones - this is not a whim or some notion based on a romantic view of the past. the cornish have, along with our welsh cousins, the longest history of any people in britain, dating back 12, 000 years. it is believed that these ancient people entered this isle after the ice age from the area now occupied by the basques. genetic codes indelibly mark the cornish with the dna of their ancient ancestors. it is believed that a staggering 80 % of the cornish retain this genetic marker. the cornish language, which is seeing a revival in recent times, has a 5, 000 - year history. we in cornwall have our own culture and our own ways. cornwall even has its own patron saint, st piran, whose life is celebrated on 5 march every year. we have our own flag and even our own tartan, which i am modelling so well with my tie this evening.']"

and despite the rhetoric, that has not been the government ' s modus operandi over the last few years - because of historic market failure. there was recognition that pub companies had failed to get their house in order, despite numerous opportunities to do so, and that there was an unfair imbalance in the relationship between powerful pub companies and tenants, who were individual small business people. for that reason, hon. members in all parts of the house voted to support the introduction of a market rent only option in the pubs code as part of the small business, enterprise and employment act 2015. the support of conservative and liberal democrat members meant that the government were defeated, and the market rent only option was put in. it is important for us all that that works, and that we deliver on the principles intended by the 2010 to 2015 parliament. i would like the minister to clarify that he is responsible for the pubs code. i was under the impression that the under -

the briefings also provide a signpost to further excellent information. i am aware of the importance of pubs in my constituency, as all hon. members will be. in rural areas in my constituency, more often than not the pub is the central focus of attention for meeting, entertaining and eating - just somewhere to meet. the importance of pubs cannot be underlined too strongly. i think it was just a few weeks ago, perhaps just before christmas, that there were pubs closing. the rate of pub closures across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland is alarming. i think that the pubs code and the pubs code adjudicator are part of a methodology to try to hold back the tide of closures, so it is important that that is in place. there was a community project where a collective got together and used their own investments to restart their pub with a major refurbishment. they did so for a purpose. they recognised that the community had lost something important and they wanted to reinstate it. pubs are important in contributing to the economy and providing jobs, and as focal points for leisure and meeting. it seems to me that hon. members stepped in to stop the monopoly that was affecting small pub tenants.""]"

drawn carriages and submarines should have been covered by the bill - we thank them for that. some of our learned labour colleagues in the other place were more than qualified to speak about this topic, as one is a former airline pilot and another the president of the british airline pilots association. i pay particular tribute to them for their work on this issue, and we thank the government for the technical amendments that they tabled in response to the concessions that we won. i reiterate the point that our colleagues in the other place made about enforcement. we have over 21, 000 fewer police officers compared with in 2010.', 'the bill has been much improved by the persistence of our labour colleagues in the other place. i am sure that the whole house would want to join me in sending condolences to my hon. friend the member for kingston upon hull east ( karl turner ). he had been leading for the opposition on the bill, but he has just lost his father, the distinguished hull city councillor ken turner. our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family today. as no amendments were tabled, i shall highlight a few points in the bill itself. it is a short bill, consisting of two substantive and two procedural clauses. clause 1 makes it an offence to direct or shine a laser beam towards a vehicle or a person in charge of a vehicle in such a way as to dazzle or distract the person driving, piloting, navigating or otherwise in control of the vehicle when it is moving or is ready to move. it results from an amendment tabled by labour colleagues in the other place. there may be mitigating circumstances if it can be proved that the use of the laser was necessary in, for example, a rescue mission to attract attention of a pilot, or that the offence was committed by accident if the laser was being used professionally and all precautions had initially been taken to prevent an incident from occurring. the penalty will be imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. advancing the deterrent sends a clear message that laser misuse will not be tolerated. it has also been clarified that a laser beam could be a pulsed or continuous light, and it is defined in clause 3. the definition of the modes of transport to which the bill will apply has been extended, thanks to the work of my labour colleagues in the other place. the bill is an important piece of health and safety legislation to safeguard those who operate modes of transport from the effect of laser misuse.', 'five years is indeed the maximum sentence and the maximum fine is unlimited. the bill extends to the entire uk and will come into force in england, wales and scotland at the end of the period of two months beginning with the day on which the bill is passed. in northern ireland, aviation and shipping are reserved, and the provisions relating to those will come into force at the same time as in the rest of the uk. the bill is now in a better shape than when it was introduced. in particular, the creation of an offence for shining a laser at air traffic control has received widespread endorsement and is one that the government are happy to support. the bill has been a great example of the important role parliament has in strengthening legislation. i also thank those outside the chamber who have lent their expertise to this important bill. the uk laser working group, chaired by air commodore dai whittingham, the civil aviation authority, nats, the maritime and coastguard agency, the trade union the british airline pilots association, the national police air service and many others have provided invaluable advice on some very technical issues. our work in this area does not stop once the bill is passed. the bill specifically covers the risk posed by shining a laser at a person in control of a vehicle, but, as we discussed on second reading, the government have also announced new measures to tackle the sale of unsafe laser pointers. more than 150 incidents of eye injuries involving laser pointers have been reported since 2013, the vast majority of them involving children. in many of these cases, neither the children nor their parents have known the danger involved. the government will work to raise awareness of the risks associated with laser pointers, including among schoolchildren. in addition, the government have pledged extra support to local authority ports and border teams to stop high -

a quorum demands 43, but president yameen announced the state of emergency extension regardless. the prosecutor general has publicly declared the state of emergency extension to be unconstitutional. despite the state of emergency and a 10. 30 pm curfew in mala©, daily anti - government protests have spread across the maldives and have now entered their fourth week."", ""i will certainly do so. i have rather long list of things to raise with the ambassador, but i will do my level best to ensure that that issue is discussed. the uk is also leading the international response, understandably. we helped to drive the eu foreign affairs council conclusions on 26 february, which called for the state of emergency to be lifted. the council announced that it would consider targeted measures if progress was not made. i also expect the uk to lead a statement of concern at the un human rights council in geneva later this week, as we did last june on behalf of more than 30 other countries. on human rights more broadly, the maldives has been one of the foreign office ' s human rights priority countries for several years. we have regularly raised our concerns about human rights, in particular the threatened re - imposition of the death penalty, with my maldivian counterparts, as have my government colleagues. we will continue to fund projects that support efforts by maldivian civil society to promote human rights, strengthen democratic institutions and advocate a greater role for women in public life. we are deeply concerned by reports of increasing radicalisation in the maldives and take them very seriously. we co - operate with the government of the maldives in the global fight against terrorism. our view is that open and pluralistic societies are better placed to combat the underlying drivers of radicalisation. my right hon. friend was right to point out that the decision by the maldives to leave the commonwealth in 2016 - an institution that was assisting it in addressing a number of these concerns - remains a source of deep sadness to us. we hope that in time the maldives will return to the commonwealth family by reapplying for membership, but clearly in its current state that cannot happen. my right hon. friend mentioned the safety of british visitors to the maldives, and many of them are there as we speak.""]"

chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on liver health. i have been the chairman now for some 13 years - simply because i do not think anyone else wants to take on the mantle, to be frank. when we set up our all - party parliamentary group, we looked for a celebrity to head it all, as one does, and we chose george best. the house might feel that george best was an unlikely person to head up the charity, but at that time he was a reformed character, and he did a lot of good in those early years. unfortunately, as we all know, a great toll was taken on his health and, sadly, he died. we then looked for another celebrity, and - what a joy - anita roddick of the body shop, who was a wonderful and remarkable lady, became our patron. she died in 2007. the house may know that she contracted hepatitis c from a blood transfusion in 1971 and was unaware that she was living with the disease until 2004. a routine blood test revealed the diagnosis. she was a tireless campaigner, and we owe her a great debt of gratitude, but since 2007 we have struggled to find a patron to head up the organisation as president. if colleagues have any ideas, i know our appg would be glad to hear from them.', 'of course, the hon. lady states a fact not an opinion, and i accept that, which is why i speak of the importance of primary care and of making every contact count. the people who portmans pharmacy interacts with are not all sick. people who have a hepatitis c infection or a drug - use issue have other issues - they get flu too - so they interact with that pharmacy, and the pharmacy makes every contact count by grabbing people earlier. that is one reason why i am so passionate about the way that that underused network can help us to reach the ambitious targets that we have set. everyone has rightly talked about prevention - in many ways, i am the minister with responsibility for prevention and it is the thing that i am most passionate about in our health service. as well as testing and treating those already infected, an essential part of tackling hepatitis c must be the prevention of infection in the first place, or the prevention of reinfection of those successfully treated, which would not be a smart use of public resources. nhs england and public health england, which i have direct ministerial responsibility for, are actively engaged in programmes at a local level to prevent the spread of infection. as people who inject drugs or share needles are at the greatest risk of acquiring hepatitis c, prevention services, particularly those provided by drug treatment centres, are key components of hepatitis c control strategies. clearly, the key to breaking the cycle of hepatitis c is to prevent infection happening in the first place.', ""it is genuinely a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr streeter, and to be back in westminster hall on such a quiet day in westminster. the hon. member for ealing, southall ( mr sharma ) is sadly not in his place today, but i thank my hon. friend the member for southend west ( sir david amess ) for securing and leading this debate. although he said that he was not the best person to introduce the debate, he could have fooled us because he did it very well. hepatitis c is a significant health issue in our country, and for too long it has been overshadowed by other public health concerns that, despite the superstars involved, have had higher public profiles. i pay tribute to the hepatitis c trust and the wonderful charles gore, whom i have got to know in this job. he is a colossus in this area, and has become a friend. i also thank the hepatitis c coalition - this issue has been central to both those organisations. my hon. friend mentioned lots of local services for southend residents, and a lot is going on in his constituency. few mps champion their constituency more than he does, so for his press release i will mention that screening and onward referral services are provided by the southend treatment and recovery service, known as stars. for primary care, gp practices refer people to the specialist treatment services in my hon. friend ' s much -

to support authorities to keep bridges and other structures safe and open, to help repair potholes or stop them forming, and to undertake further minor highway works where necessary. we will be announcing individual allocations to highways authorities shortly, but i am sure that members across the house will welcome this funding, which comes in addition to over a£6 billion that we are providing to local highway authorities in england outside london between 2015 and 2021, including a£296 million for a pothole action fund, which is being allocated to local highway authorities between 2016 and 2021 to help repair potholes. the chancellor also announced a further a£150 million in the budget to improve local traffic hotspots such as roundabouts. it is our intention that this funding will help to improve existing local road junctions, to ease congestion bottlenecks and to improve reliability - not only to improve access, but to make sure that these junctions are safer for all road users. further details will be announced in due course.', ""i am grateful to the hon. lady for that intervention. of course it is a matter not just of specific behaviour around schools, but of speed and the effects not merely of congestion, but on air quality. i will be touching on some of that later in the speech. the roads we use are only one part of the overall picture of road safety. earlier this year, we granted a£100 million to improve 50 of the most dangerous stretches of a road in england through the safer roads fund. we have already seen all of the 50 road schemes receive funding, and we expect the work to be completed by 2020. i was very pleased to note that, in the road safety foundation ' s latest publication, a€œgetting back on tracka€, the most improved road is the a161 in the east riding of yorkshire. the improvements to this road were joint funded between the safer roads fund and the east riding of yorkshire council. the budget last week highlighted the importance of our local road network. the local highway network is one of the most valuable national assets and an essential component of our economy. a good, well - maintained and safe local highway network has never been more important. the house will know that i think we need a substantial approach, and i will outline what that approach is. local authorities have an existing legal duty to maintain the highway under section 41 of the highways act 1980, as amended. if the hon. member for middlesbrough ( andy mcdonald ) wishes to make an intervention, he is very welcome to do so. if he does not, perhaps he would care to stop chuntering from a sedentary position. good transport and roads are essential to this country ' s economic growth.""]"

i suspect forlornly - call for a review of the effects of making provisions to discount excess profits of a private finance initiative company for the purpose of calculating the aggregate of the interest allowance of worldwide groups under the provisions in part 10 of the taxation ( international and other provisions ) act 2010. we support that as a step in the right direction to tackle the whole construct and operation of pfi schemes, which was a policy announced last september by my right hon. friend the member for hayes and harlington ( john mcdonnell ), the shadow chancellor. the bank levy was not the brainchild of a conservative government. it was not introduced because the previous chancellor had been suddenly moved by public outrage about reckless decisions made by some in the banking sector who plunged us into the world ' s greatest economic crisis in modern times. that is the context for this issue."", ""as always, it is an enormous pleasure to follow the hon. member for bootle ( peter dowd ), whose speeches are always entertaining and occasionally informative. he spent a great deal of time talking about the bank levy and the various new clauses standing in his name on that topic. i wish to start by addressing the central thesis of his comments on the bank levy : his suggestion that banks are not paying their fair share, particularly as two of them received state money from about 2009. it is a matter of incontrovertible fact that banks, as organisations, are paying more tax proportionately than other kinds of corporates. it is of course right that they do, for the reason that the hon. gentleman and my right hon. friend the member for broxtowe ( anna soubry ) mentioned : they did receive taxpayer money. they pay this extra money, compared with other businesses, in two ways. the first is through the surplus profit tax of 8 % - they pay about a third more corporation tax proportionately than a non - bank corporation does. the second is through the bank levy. although the bank levy is being reduced, it will remain in force, so banks will continue to pay proportionately more tax than non - bank businesses after the implementation of this budget. that is a vital point to get across. the hon. gentleman also tried to link funding for children ' s services to the bank levy. in one of my interventions, i gave some figures on the total amount of tax that banks are paying. we can argue about why they are paying that extra tax. clearly, it is at least in part due to the surplus profits rate and to the bank levy. it may also, in part, be due to the fact that the banks ' profits have increased."", ""perhaps we can get into the nitty - gritty of this offline. the average revenue from the bank levy between its introduction in 2011 and 2015 - 16 was around a£2. 6 billion. as a result of this package, however, yield from the surcharge and the levy in 2022 - 23 is forecast to be a£3. 2 billion. by 2023, as i have said, we will have raised around a£44 billion in additional bank taxes since the 2010 election. opposition members have also suggested that our bank levy is set at a low level compared with other countries. in fact, not all financial centres have a bank levy. the usa, for example, chose not to introduce one at all, and while several eu countries introduced bank levies following the financial crisis, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between these levies as the rules for each are different. we have heard the argument this afternoon that we should reintroduce a tax on bankers ' pay. one of the aims of the changes to bank taxation announced in 2015 and 2016 is to ensure a sustainable long - term basis for taxing banks, based on taxing bank profits and the bank levy. by contrast, the bank payroll tax referred to in new clause 3 was always intended as a one - off tax. reintroducing it would be ineffective and unsustainable compared with the package of banking tax measures that we have introduced. even the last labour chancellor pointed out that it could not be repeated without significant tax avoidance. opposition members also propose that hmrc should publish a register of tax paid by individual banks under the levy. taxpayer confidentiality is rightly a core principle for trust in our tax system and hmrc does not publish details of the amount of tax paid by any individual business.""]"

or not, depending on how they apply - for the purposes of future amendment or reform of those rights and retained law, certain aspects should be treated as primary legislation and others as secondary legislation. i think the right hon. and learned gentleman was saying that issues that fell under article 289 should be treated as primary legislation because they were of greater import, and that if we wanted to amend them again in the future we should do so by act of parliament, whereas aspects of retained eu law that related to delegated instruments under article 290 should be treated as secondary legislation, and if there were future reforms of those aspects, parliament could use the secondary procedure. it would be most helpful if the right hon. and learned gentleman could give us a little more detail about why he felt that those were the right categories to pursue.', 'i cannot give way, because i really must press on. we are committed to proper scrutiny and engagement with parliament and the public on our corrections to eu law and future changes. in addition to all the changes we have already made to the bill, there will be a presumption in favour of engagement or consultation where it is proportionate and sensible to do so. of course, departments will consult where there is a statutory duty to do so. departments across whitehall have already undertaken engagement or consultation with stakeholders for active discussions on areas where that has been proportionate and sensible, and that will only increase. most of those who have supported lords amendment 4 are well intentioned, but some must have known that it would have hugely detrimental effects on how we could deliver a functioning statute book ahead of our exit and in the future. instead of protecting the law in the crucial areas of employment, equality, health, consumer standards and environmental protection, it would weaken it. by calling this amendment a€œenhanced protectiona€, some are seeking to hide a great danger. by limiting the changes that delegated powers could make to retained eu law relating to the specified policy areas to only those that are deemed technical, the amendment would fundamentally limit our ability to properly correct deficiencies. that risks dramatically increasing the amount of primary legislation that needs to be enacted ahead of our exit, putting more pressure on this place ahead of brexit. even the changes deemed to be a€œtechnicala€ enough to be achieved through delegated powers would still face a lengthy enhanced scrutiny process, which the lords could force to be as long as the 18 months required for legislative and regulatory reform orders. in other words, our statute book could not be made ready for exit by 29 march 2019.', ""the situation is set out in detail in the written ministerial statement that we laid. both houses will have meaningful votes on whether to accept the agreement. it is my expectation that we would not ratify before that primary legislation has gone through. new clause 1 was tabled by the labour front - bench team. it seeks to place limitations on the use of existing and future powers to amend and modify retained eu law. it is absolutely right and necessary for existing domestic powers granted by parliament in other acts and any future delegated powers created after exit day to be able to operate effectively and without inappropriate fetter within uk domestic law after our departure from the eu. this includes parts of our existing domestic law which will become retained eu law after exit day, as well as retained direct eu legislation which will be converted into our domestic statute book. the bill ' s current approach to existing and future delegated powers aims to ensure the successful operation of retained eu law within our domestic statute book beyond the time limits for the bill ' s more limited specific powers. adopting the new clause, on the other hand, would undermine the position of certainty and have several detrimental effects that would risk creating significant confusion in the uk statute book. first, limiting the modification of retained eu law by existing and future delegated powers only to when this is necessarya€œto maintain or enhance rights and protectionsa€could have uncertain consequences. a test of necessity would impose a high burden that may prevent powers from being used in the most appropriate and relevant way if the regulations they create are not deemed truly necessary for the protection of rights. that could mean that existing and future delegated powers would be unable to amend or modify irrelevant or unsuitable parts of the statute book, leading to ossification of parts of retained eu law within uk domestic law and creating confusion and uncertainty.""]"

run housing association in the city. it has improved the quality of life for many glaswegians over the years. michael epitomised all that was good about the labour movement and the opportunity that it has afforded for the advancement of working - class people over the last century. he inspired many local young people into a vocation in politics. i have been particularly moved by the number of constituents who have contacted me in the past couple of days to express their gratitude for the help that michael provided to their family or to their neighbours. to this day, on every single street in my constituency, michael is fondly remembered, even though he never sought any great recognition for his efforts. he often referred to the lesson in the gospel of st luke about jesus healing 10 lepers, but only one coming back to thank him. michael sought to help people humbly, quietly and without any need for praise.', ""on behalf of her majesty ' s government, i join you, mr speaker, in expressing our sadness at the death on sunday of the former house of commons speaker, michael martin - latterly, lord martin of springburn. as we remember his life and contribution to this place today, the thoughts and prayers of the whole house will be with his family and friends. first elected to the house of commons for the seat of glasgow, springburn in 1979, michael martin was dedicated to the people of glasgow. he was a proud scotsman who never forgot his roots, and some members, including my right hon. friend the secretary of state for scotland, experienced his bagpipes playing at his annual burns night supper, which i gather was something of a special event. he demonstrated that pride during his time as a back - bench member, during his spell as parliamentary private secretary to denis healey between 1981 and 1983 and, of course, during his time as a cross - bench peer in the other place. as a back - bench member, in addition to representing his constituents in glasgow, michael martin was a member of the trade and industry committee between 1983 and 1987. in 1987 he became first deputy chairman of ways and means, and he was elected to the position of speaker in october 2000. in the debate before his election, he said : a€œmy apprenticeship has been one of serving the house as a chairman of standing committees, the administration committee and the scottish grand committee. i have never sought to be a whip, a front - bench spokesman or a minister... i have enjoyed defending the rights of the house. a€ - michael martin served as speaker for almost nine years. he was introduced to the house of lords in august 2009, where he was an active cross - bench peer."", ""on behalf of the opposition, i thank you, mr speaker, for your kind words, and the leader of the house for hers, in leading the tributes to lord martin of springburn. like her, i was not a member when he was the speaker of the house. every speaker has their own style and is a speaker of their time, and he had to contend with some challenges. but we can remember the fact that he left school without qualifications at 15, and from a poverty - stricken background he ended up as the first catholic speaker, in one of the most senior posts in public life. michael martin worked as a sheet metal worker at rolls royce, and then as a full - time organiser for the national union of public employees - nupe. there he met another union organiser who ended up as leader of the opposition. he entered parliament in 1979 for glasgow, springburn and then for glasgow north east, serving this place for 30 years. he was a member of numerous committees and he clearly knew how this place worked. when elected speaker, he sat in the chair without tights - as you said, mr speaker - a practice for speakers he abolished. he started his tenure by holding a press conference - a very progressive move. he also served in the other place from 2009 - nearly 40 years of public service. you mentioned michael ' s kindness : a member told me how anyone from a working - class background was always shown support so that they did not feel out of place in parliament. a member of staff, who was also from a glasgow housing estate, told me how michael wrote to her mother saying how proud she should be of her daughter ' s contribution in parliament. to michael ' s wife mary, his son paul, his daughter mary ann and his family, we send our condolences at this difficult time.""]"

as i said, passenger journeys have increased by 42 % on competitive lines, compared with 27 % on those that have no competition ; revenue has increased by 57 %, compared with 48 % ; and average fares have increased by only 11 %, compared with 17 %. the east coast main line has open access operators such as grand central trains and hull trains. other rail lines around the country would do well to replicate that model. open access operators take no support from the taxpayer. the open access model creates competition on the line, which has led to fantastic results. in fact, since that has been the case on the east coast, the main line has had the highest satisfaction ratings in the country. the east coast open access operators deliver the very highest rates : in 2015 first hull trains and grand central each had a 94 % passenger satisfaction rate, which was the joint highest score of all operators. that was confirmed in 2016 and 2017 in the passenger satisfaction surveys conducted by the competition and markets authority. in 2016, the cma recommended more on - track competition generally, either with much more open access to compete with franchises on the same lines or with multiple operators to provide services in a fully commercial environment. unlike the cma, however, the government are yet formally to declare their support for the principle of extended open access. perhaps the minister will take up the offer to do so this afternoon. open access competition has led to new routes being opened or reopened. without open access on the east coast main line, would places such as sunderland, hartlepool, halifax and bradford have the frequent, direct and high - speed long - distance services from which they now benefit? something similar desperately needs to be replicated in northern lincolnshire.', 'my right hon. friend has made an important observation. we can certainly look at ways to make tickets more fungible, but the purpose of the present integrated smart ticketing system is to enable passengers to a€œturn up and goa€, to use the latest technology and so on. as yet, it has not focused on making tickets fungible between operators, and i am sure that is something that, as the open access policy develops and as open access develops as a feature of our system, will become more prevalent. as the cma recommended, however, a greater role for open access requires robust reforms to create a level playing field between different types of operator. at present, as my hon. friend the member for weston - super - mare knows, open access operators do not pay towards the fixed costs of the network on which they operate, nor do they contribute towards the vital social services that the franchised operators that they compete with deliver. that distorts the incentives of operators and means that we cannot realise the full benefits of competition for passengers. that is why we are now working closely with the office of rail regulation on its proposals for reforming track access charges in the next rail control period, from 2019 to 2024. these reforms will see open access operators pay an appropriate amount towards the fixed costs of the network where they are able to. we support this move as a vital step in creating the level playing field between open access and franchised operators. we have also consulted on a possible public service obligation levy. such a levy would complement track access charging reform, so that open access operators would also pay towards the social services that franchises deliver to many stations. those stations would not have the levels of service they do today if left entirely to the free market, and the government offer greater passenger choice through the franchising system to deliver social as well as economic benefits.']"

class pshe looks like, going forward into the 2020s. i hope that this debate will be a useful part of that process. pshe in this country has suffered on several fronts. it has been caught up in sterile debates about the difference between knowledge and skills, and about school freedom. it has also become a battleground because of its status as the home of sex and relationships education. it has been incorrectly associated with generic and sometimes obscure pet subjects - even origami. often, we have lost sight of the fact that pshe at its best supports the development of skills and attributes such as managing risk and taking responsibility, and the honing of critical skills that set young people up to succeed in other areas of the curriculum and in their wider lives. surely that is what education is about. despite some of the cartoon battles that i have mentioned, there is a fair level of consensus about what pshe includes : the knowledge and skills that young people need to stay safe - online and offline - healthy, and prepared for life.', ""at that point, if the child wishes to have sex education, the headteacher should ensure they receive it in one of those three terms. this preserves the parental right in most cases, but balances that with the child ' s right to opt in to sex education when they are competent to do so. we are keen to hear as many views as possible through the consultation, and i encourage members and their constituents to respond. the consultation will be open until early november and the final regulations will be laid in both houses, allowing for a full and considered debate. this very important change to the curriculum has to be delivered well, and although many schools will be able to adapt their existing teaching quickly, it is essential that schools that need more time to plan and to prepare their staff get that time. it is our intention that as many schools as possible will start teaching the subjects from september 2019. we will be working with schools, as well as with multi - academy trusts, dioceses and education unions, to help them to do so. all schools will be required to teach the new subjects from september 2020, which is in line with the department ' s approach that any significant changes to the curriculum have a year ' s lead - in time. that will enable us to learn lessons from early - adopter schools and to share good practice further across the sector. we will be seeking views through the consultation to test the right focus for a school support package as we know that it is crucial for schools and teachers to be confident and well prepared. our proposals are an historic step in education that will help to equip children and young people with the knowledge and support that they need to form healthy relationships, lead healthy lives, and be safe and happy in modern britain. i commend the statement to the house."", 'i thank the hon. lady for the tone and content of her response. i join her in thanking and commending all those on both sides of the house who have been involved in the development of these matters over quite an extended period, particularly during the passage of the bill that became the children and social work act. the hon. lady asked what was truly mandatory. the only part of the curriculum that it is possible to withdraw from is the sex part of relationships and sex education. if a primary school offered sex education - that is not mandatory, but if it were - the right to withdraw would also apply there. the hon. lady asked - it is a reasonable question - how we make sure this actually happens. schools have an obligation to have regard to guidance, and they do. there is also, of course, the system of ofsted inspection, which looks at the moral and spiritual development of children. on how the right to withdraw will operate and the ability of children to opt in, there will continue to be, as i outlined in my statement, a parental right to withdraw. its nature will change because the age - 18 right is no longer consistent with legal precedent. there are cases where the parent wishes to withdraw the child from sex education and the child does not want that, but we are not expecting large numbers of those. only a very small number of parents now withdraw their children from sex education ; of course, there is sex education in most schools. in that case, the child would be able to access a term of sex education before reaching 16. the hon. lady is absolutely right about bullying, including bullying of children who are lgbt. a couple of things are very important and essential in that regard.']"

although i am not sure whether it should be given to me or my husband. the whole concept of making a commitment and marrying somebody was a very big decision, and our wedding day was a most momentous day, and our union is forever recorded on our marriage certificate. but currently on our precious marriage certificate there is no reference to my poor mother at all, even though she bore me and virtually died - something she has never stopped reminding me of since. i tell her i was trying to make my presence felt at a very early stage. similarly, when my two daughters get married - if they do - as the law stands, my name will not be on the marriage certificate. one might reflect that that is of no particular consequence, but as my hon. friend the member for erewash ( maggie throup ) pointed out, genealogists and others interested in tracing their family history or the social history of women will be unable to find this kind of information because it is not recorded. that is a great pity, especially as so much progress has been made on women ' s equality."", ""my hon. friend is impatient. i will confirm that later in my speech : there is plenty more to come. my hon. friend got in first, but it was not really necessary. i am aware that i have majored on the first of the four parts of the bill. it has three other important components, which i think are less complicated and hopefully less contentious. the fact that my late mother could not add her name as a parent on my marriage certificate is an anachronism, well past its sell - by date and, frankly, an outrage. in fact, the signatures of both my mother and my mother - in - law were included on our marriage certificate, but at our discretion, and as the signatures of witnesses rather than parents. my father signed, as did my wife ' s father, because in the days when the anomaly originated, a daughter was a father ' s chattel for him to give away, and literally sign away. that has been the case in england since 1837, the beginning of queen victoria ' s reign, and has not changed since then. the problem apparently lies with the current system of marriage registration, which relies on hard - copy register books held in churches and other religious establishments as well as register offices. that involves some 84, 000 open register books in 30, 000 churches and religious buildings, so it is quite a big undertaking. surely, in this digital age, it is not beyond the wit of man or woman to introduce a single electronic register instead of relying on hard - copy books. that would avoid the potentially costly need to replace all the register books. instead of signing a book at the ceremony, the newly married couple would sign a document that would then be returned to the register office to be entered in the existing electronic register so that an official marriage certificate could be issued, including the names of all the parents.""]"

17, local authorities spent a£682 million, or a£29 per household, to keep our streets clean. in addition, highways england spends at least a£6 million a year on collecting litter from the strategic road network. those funds could be better used to deliver the range of important services provided by our councils. our litter strategy, which was published last year, was the first ever for england, and it was produced in partnership with the department for transport and the ministry of housing, communities and local government. we have delivered on a number of key commitments that we detailed, as set out in the annual report, which i assure the house will be published shortly. councils now have new enforcement powers they can use, making it easier for action to be taken against people who litter, principally through the use of fixed penalty notices. the big change has been to make the owner, or more precisely the keeper, of a vehicle liable for littering offences committed from it, although i recognise that this power has already been in place in london councils for some time."", ""i will. we should take pride in the fact that so many members of our communities are prepared to put their own time, effort and hard work into tackling litter. in that regard, i highlight the staff at mcdonald ' s friern barnet, who regularly go out to litter pick. those volunteer efforts are hugely to be welcomed, but we also need to ensure that we have an effective response from the government and local councils. allocation of responsibility for clearing highway litter is governed by the environmental protection act 1990. local councils have that duty in relation to the majority of roads, including trunk roads in the strategic road network. highways england is charged with maintenance and litter clearance on motorways and a small number of trunk roads. similarly, transport for london is responsible for maintenance and litter clearance on several strategic routes in the london region. that means that there are many cases where the body responsible for maintaining the road and its verges is not responsible for litter clearance on those verges. we also end up in a situation where small district councils are supposed to clear litter from busy major roads but are not geared up for the extensive organisation that comes with health and safety requirements, such as coning off lanes or shutting roads altogether, as in the example near my constituency, which i referred to earlier. will the government consider reforming the law to provide that the body responsible for maintaining a road and the roadside is also the one tasked with clearing litter from that roadside? in particular, that reform would mean that highways england had an increased duty to clear the litter around all the roads for which it is responsible, and it would make it much easier to combine work such as trimming roadside vegetation with litter picking, so clearance could take place more regularly and efficiently.""]"

be that with the health visitor, a midwife who might come to the home or someone in the hospital. we need to look at the whole spectrum of engagement to ensure that we consider the mental health of mum and baby every step of the way. i mentioned mother and baby units, which are incredibly important. for anyone who does not know, they are an opportunity to ensure that if the mum is experiencing a period of psychosis or another serious mental illness, they are still able to be with their child. the units offer extremely specialised care and incredible attention from clinicians, who do a remarkable job of ensuring attachment so that mums are not disconnected from their babies, even if they have to be moved across the country. mother and baby units are very important for recovery rates. i have asked several parliamentary questions about them, but i want to ask more in the context of this debate because of their importance to mums who experience post - partum psychosis. in january, i asked the secretary of state, in a written question, a€œhow many mother and baby beds commissioned by nhs england specialised services in 2016 / 17 are ( a ) available and ( b ) in use. a€i asked that because although we know that beds have been commissioned, it is not clear whether they are available or in use.', 'i will write to the hon. lady with some detail on the figures, but the point is that the access is there. obviously, it will take time to become embedded. we have a good direction of travel to deliver against that commitment and we will continue with that. community - based provision is key, but we also need to ensure that there are sufficient specialist perinatal mental health beds in mother and baby units for particularly severe cases. nhs england has taken a more strategic approach to commissioning, so that there is a level of access that does not involve wide - scale moving out of area. as ever with transformation programmes, change takes time, but we are on track to meet our commitments. we are investing a£63. 5 million this financial year to support the development of those specialist perinatal mental health community services across england. our pace of change is to enable 2, 000 more women to access specialist care. last year that was exceeded, so we should maintain the pace that we planned in the five - year forward view. i have visited one of the new in - patient mother and baby units in chelmsford, where there are four new beds. that centre is expanding its capacity. as well as opening new centres, we are expanding the capacity of existing ones to give more support. in devon, the trust opened a four - bed mother and baby unit in a reused space in april this year while the new unit is being built, so we still have that provision even though there is not the physical space. by the end of this financial year, we will have expanded the capacity of those beds by 49 % since 2015 and there should be more than 150 beds available for mothers and babies in those units. we are also expanding psychological therapy services, which successfully treat many women who experience common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders during the perinatal period.', ""i thank my hon. friend for her intervention. i have avoided, as much as i can, talking about money in the debate - not all of this is about money, but there are many opportunities to make a massive difference. if we can draw a direct link between a mum ' s experiencing mental health problems and the damage that that may do to her child - it increases the child ' s chance of developing health problems and even of being involved in crime later in life - there are certainly opportunities to invest to save. we must not forget, either, that perinatal mental illness has serious consequences for the mother. suicide is the leading cause of direct maternal deaths occurring within a year after the end of pregnancy in the uk. it is at least possible that if an effective six - week check were in place, some of those deaths would be prevented. of course, this is, as many hon. members have said, a complex issue. diagnosis and treatment are complex, but in addition some health services undoubtedly do not give women the care that they need. women feel that they are still being dismissed, stigmatised and ignored. however, we should not blame the individual gps and health professionals who carry out the checks ; we should look to change the guidance, the system and the structure in place. from its research, the nct has made three recommendations. the first is to fund the six - week maternal post - natal check so that gp surgeries have the time and resources to give every new mother a full appointment for the maternal check. at the moment, although the check focusing on the baby is contracted for and there is funding available for it, there is no requirement for a six - week check on mothers. checks on mothers, if they are done, are often compressed into the baby ' s check, so conversations about mental health may be rushed or sidelined completely.""]"

term deal dividend for britain. the bank of england last week published its modelling of a range of scenarios to assess the potential impact as the economy makes the necessary adjustment to reflect the new trading relationship between the uk and the eu. the bank estimated that a negotiated deal could boost british gdp by 1. 75 % in the short term, as businesses and consumers alike express their confidence in the future, while leaving the eu on wto rules and without a transition period could cause a recession, with gdp reduced by up to 7. 75 % and unemployment rising to 7. 5 %. the bank of england is clear : a no -

case scenario is a no - deal brexit, which would leave us 9. 3 % worse off over that 15 - year period. we did not need that analysis to tell us that a no - deal brexit is a significant threat to this country, but the choice facing us today is not between a bad deal or no deal. there are strong economic grounds for us to vote down this deal and to seek a different brexit with the eu, or to remain as we are. coventry has a long history of manufacturing, and 11, 000 people in my constituency work in the manufacturing industry, just as i did. because of that, i have had regular meetings with some of the biggest manufacturers in coventry, including jaguar land rover, meggitt and the london electric vehicle company. throughout the brexit negotiations, they have been concerned about what brexit will mean for future business in the eu. anybody who knows anything about manufacturing knows that manufacturers need at least some stability to look forward four or five years -

she has started a company called tip tap, a mobile phone app that will allow diners to give their tips directly to the waiter. they can pay the bill to the restaurant, the waiter will get out their app and then they can pay the tip to the waiter directly. that seems an example of a good solution, but i still do not quite understand why restaurant owners and others feel it is a particular hassle to facilitate that process for their workers, who are often the lowest - paid in those businesses - as i say, on average, they earn only around a£7. 71 an hour. this is a simplistic debate ;

trade in services is broadly in balance. romania is the 18th largest market in the eu for uk exports, and the 19th largest in terms of imports. i can well believe that romania ' s will to continue that trade, in which it has the upper hand, will ensure that a way is found to do that, and that is my hope."", 'i shall come on to the question of the number of people leaving romania and coming to this country in a few moments, but the clear concern in romania is that the young people who leave are not yet returning in any number. they may return in future, and it is true that in certain countries, such as poland, people have started to return and to invest. a number of people who are resident in the uk are investing in romania, but the concern in romania is still about the huge numbers who are leaving and, at the moment, not returning, which puts a great strain on the country. romanians are also concerned about the trafficking of romanian women and children through the european union, including the uk. people are being trafficked for the sex trade and other illicit purposes, such as the drugs trade. clearly that is of concern to the ministry for romanians abroad, and it is one of those areas that we as a parliament need to examine, to ensure that people who come here have chosen to do so of their own free will and accord to contribute directly to our economy, as so many do. equally, tourism and trade provide both a challenge and opportunity. such opportunities will grow dramatically over the next few years. indeed, the deputy prime minister of romania, whom we met on our trip, is married to a british businessman - who i happened to see last week when he was over here. they have been married for a long time. there are also clearly strong economic bilateral relations, all demonstrating the strength of support for the united kingdom and romania. one or two aspects of modern romania and what is happening there are probably not widely known. we visited a number of jewish sites in bucharest. one synagogue is being turned into a holocaust museum, to commemorate and recall the tragic events in romania during the nazi era.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered uk - romanian relations. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, mr betts. i declare an interest, as i am the chairman of the all - party group for romania. i welcome colleagues who were involved in a recent all - party group visit to romania, and those who went there a couple of years ago under the auspices of the inter - parliamentary union. before i talk about the current situation, it is pertinent to review the relationship between our two great countries, which has existed for more than 100 years. our diplomatic relations with romania were established on 20 february 1880, but there was a considerable period, particularly during the second world war and the cold war, when relations were not as friendly as they currently are, so 1990 is considered to be the start of the modern uk - romania relationship. our relationship has grown stronger and stronger over the past 28 years. the united kingdom was a firm supporter of romania ' s joining nato - i will say a bit more about that later - and the european union, and we championed its calls to join both organisations. the strategic partnership that we currently enjoy was established in 2003. last summer, british troops undertook key exercises with romania and other nato allies in the black sea region and the east of romania. our excellent ambassador, paul brummell, noted that it was the busiest period of activity in our bilateral defence engagement in recent memory. that demonstrates our shared history of defence and economic co - operation. our relationship is not limited to our diplomatic or economic relations. prince charles has a sprawling estate in transylvania and visits romania regularly - at least once a year. this year ' s visit coincided with our visit to romania, and many of the key people met him and went to see his estate.""]"

thirdly, how is the uk supporting the church ' s peace - building work in south sudan? the south sudan council of churches has been invited to lead a new peace initiative in south sudan. how can the uk best support those efforts? fourthly, what support are the uk government providing to the ceasefire and transitional security arrangements monitoring mechanism? it is vital that that body is responsive to violations to ensure that perpetrators are held to account. fifthly, what steps are the uk government taking to ensure that the hybrid court is set up as soon as possible in south sudan? tackling the culture of impunity for south sudanese leaders will be crucial in preventing future atrocities. finally, what is the uk ' s view on the current plan of the government of south sudan to hold elections in the near future? it is impossible to imagine free and fair elections taking place in south sudan, and the result risks conferring credibility on the government of south sudan while they continue to commit human rights abuses. in closing, i pay tribute to all the activists and campaigners in south sudan who are rising above the dreadful violence to fight for peace in their country. after decades of conflict, their resilience is truly inspirational."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir graham. i pay tribute to the hon. member for scunthorpe ( nic dakin ) for the eloquent way in which he described the situation in south sudan and for the work that he does as vice - chair of the all - party parliamentary group on sudan and south sudan. i add my appreciation for the work done by chris trott and the team on the uk ' s role in the peace process. last summer, the prime minister decided to combine the role of minister for africa with the role of minister in the department for international development, which makes enormous sense when we are discussing matters such as this. we completely agree that the grim situation in south sudan, as outlined by the hon. gentleman, is an entirely man - made crisis. as always in such situations, however, the uk is at the leading edge in terms of the humanitarian response. we have consistently been one of the top three donors in south sudan. our drinking water package alone reached almost 700, 000 people. more than 400, 000 people received food, and almost 400, 000 received nutrition support. more than 6. 5 million health consultations were delivered in south sudan, of which 2. 5 million were for children under five. we have funded almost 4, 000 schools to deliver basic education. at a time when the population of south sudan is suffering from this terrible man - made violence, uk aid is providing that life - saving support. clearly, however, the question that we need to discuss is what more the uk can do to try to ensure peace in south sudan. it is only through peace that we will be able to move beyond providing aid to trying to build a stronger economy in south sudan. i will outline some of the events of that peace process, which is timely because there have been recent developments, as reported during the debate.""]"

that was the view of many peers when the bill first appeared in the house. i pay tribute to peers on all sides."", ""i speak as a member of the joint committee on human rights. we looked at this whole issue generally in our report in june, and we looked more specifically at the bill in october, so i declare that interest. article 5 of the european convention on human rights sets out the right to liberty and security. it says that no one shall be deprived of their libertya€œsave... in accordance with a procedure determined by lawa€. that essential safeguard applies to all those who are deprived of their liberty, not just people in the criminal justice system, and so it should. the previous system involved the deprivation of liberty safeguards, which were criticised by the house of lords committee on the mental capacity act 2005. the committee found thata€œfar from being used to protect individuals and their rights, they are sometimes used to oppress individuals, and to force upon them decisions made by others without reference to the wishes and feelings of the person concerned. a€so reform is most definitely needed. the only guidance that the mental capacity act 2005 gives to the courts is thata€œreferences to deprivation of a person ' s liberty have the same meaning as in article 5 ( 1 ) of the human rights convention. a€the supreme court, as has been mentioned, has defined deprivation of liberty in an a€œacid testa€ that covers all those who are under a€œcontinuous supervision and controla€ and a€œnot free to leavea€, regardless of their condition or contentment. it was logical of the supreme court to do that, but it has none the less meant that hundreds of thousands of people who were not previously considered as being deprived of their liberty may now be so considered, and 125, 630 people have been unlawfully deprived of their liberty between 2017 and 2018."", ""i beg to move an amendment, to leave out from a€œthata€ to the end of the question and add : a€œthis house declines to give a second reading to the mental capacity ( amendment ) bill, notwithstanding the need for reform to the current system of mental capacity assessments and while acknowledging the improvements made to the bill by the house of lords, because the bill underwent no pre - legislative scrutiny, it does not put the interests of the cared - for person at the heart of the bill, it enshrines a conflict of interest in relation to independent providers of health and care services, it fails to provide measures to reduce the substantial backlog of deprivation of liberty safeguards assessments and it fails to recognise explicitly the interface with the mental health act when determining which legislation should be used to authorise care or treatment arrangements. a€the issue before the house today is one of fundamental importance to us all : the individual liberty of vulnerable people. today, we are being asked under which conditions it is right to deprive vulnerable people of that liberty when they need care and treatment and cannot give their consent, and what protections should be in place when their liberty is taken away. the proposals in the bill to replace deprivation of liberty safeguards have the scope to affect the rights of a large portion of the 2 million people in the uk thought to lack capacity to make their own decisions. among them are people with dementia, learning disabilities, autism and brain injuries. whether to deprive some of the most vulnerable people in this country of their liberty should be an issue that we treat with the utmost respect, thought and care. however, i am afraid the government ' s approach to this immensely important issue has shown few of those qualities.""]"

joint enterprise has been applied in cases for more than 300 years, although it is a common law that has never been passed by parliament. the doctrine allows for more than one person to be charged for the same offence, despite the fact that they may have played a different role, or no role, in the crime. joint enterprise applies to all crimes, but in recent years it has been particularly used as a way to prosecute murder, especially, but not exclusively, in cases involving groups of young men. this is obviously a very emotive issue, particularly for families of murder victims, and no one is suggesting that those who commit murder, or who knowingly and intentionally assist in committing murder, should not face the full force of the law. however, nor should the evidential bar for serious offences like murder be lower, by virtue of presence or association with the principal offender, as we have all too often seen. indeed, there are many cases, many of which i am sure will come to light today, in which people are serving life sentences when it is clear that they did not commit murder but were found guilty under the a€œolda€ or a€œwronga€ law of parasitic accessory liability."", ""mr deputy speaker, along with the whole house i welcome you back to the chair. i congratulate the hon. member for manchester central ( lucy powell ) on securing this debate and thank mr speaker and the backbench business committee for granting it. i draw the attention of the house to my outside interests as set out in the register. we are holding this debate today because we know that thousands of people have been prosecuted under joint enterprise over the last decade alone, and we have a profound fear that some of these convictions are unsound. i am deeply conscious that behind each of these crimes lies a victim, usually murdered, with grieving loved ones whose lives have been changed for ever and ruined. my heart goes out to all those and their families who have suffered in that way. but we also know that there is a wealth of evidence that suggests that joint enterprise has both convicted people in error and wholly disproportionately affected those who identify as black, asian and minority ethnic. young people from ethnic communities have been, essentially, hoovered up for peripheral and in some cases even non - existent involvement in serious criminal acts. the supreme court ' s decision in the case of jogee has established that the previous interpretation of the law was wrong and confirmed the abolition of what i am advised lawyers call parasitic accessory liability, to which the hon. lady referred. but to date only a very limited number of joint enterprise convictions have been quashed. to find a defendant guilty of a criminal offence, a jury must be satisfied that a defendant both committed the crime and had the requisite state of mind to carry out the crime. yet the law on joint enterprise, and secondary liability more generally, was developed by the courts to ensure that all participants in a criminal enterprise could be held accountable. indeed, it has been a key tool when prosecuting suspected gang members."", 'i beg to move, that this house notes the supreme court judgment in the case of jogee and ruddock of february 2016 that the law on joint enterprise and parasitic accessory liability had been wrongly interpreted for more than 30 years ; further notes that since that judgment, the number of cases brought under joint enterprise has remained unchanged ; further notes that there have yet to be any successful appeals of cases from before february 2016 ; and calls on the government to review the use of joint enterprise and to bring forward legislative proposals to clarify the law on joint enterprise. i welcome you back to your place in the chair, mr deputy speaker, and i am sure that the whole house will join me in wishing you and your family all the best ; i know that it has been a very difficult few weeks for you. i thank the backbench business committee for accepting the application for this important debate, and i thank the right hon. and hon. members who supported that application, particularly the right hon. member for sutton coldfield ( mr mitchell ), the hon. member for bromley and chislehurst ( robert neill ) and my right hon. friend the member for tottenham ( mr lammy ), all of whom were co - sponsors of the application. i also thank the families and campaigners on joint enterprise, who are known as jengba - joint enterprise : not guilty by association - and many of whom are in the public gallery today. they have never given up in their fight for justice for their loved ones. why are we having this debate now?

they also have a positive impact on increasing economic productivity. widespread access to vaccines in developing countries offers many benefits, including direct medical savings by preventing illness, and also through indirect economic benefits such as educational attainment, labour productivity, cognitive development, higher income, savings, and of course investment. i could go on. to put it simply, healthy children are more likely to attend schools and become economically productive adults. vaccinating a baby benefits everyone in the long run. as all of us in the chamber will note, we have all been through the vaccination process and are of course eternally grateful for it. a harvard university study published in february in the journal health affairs modelled the health and economic impact of vaccines for 10 diseases in 41 developing countries. it showed that increasing vaccination rates in developing countries could reduce poverty."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr evans. i thank my right hon. friend the member for preseli pembrokeshire ( stephen crabb ) for securing this important debate. we must not underestimate the value of human capital to the future of developing countries. around the world, year on year, countries are still losing the talent and potential of countless people, including children, whose lives are tragically cut short by vaccine - preventable diseases. the vaccines for these diseases exist : if we want those countries to reach their fullest economic potential, ensuring people there have access to vaccination must be one of our highest priorities. vaccines are vital in every sense of the word. they ensure that as many people as possible - children and adults - live and enjoy healthier lives throughout the world. healthier people are more able to go to school and work, and to drive the growth of their countries ' economies, intellectually or physically. the logic and the evidence are clear : vaccines are a powerful force for economic development and wealth creation. a recent harvard study projected that vaccines will prevent 36 million deaths by 2030 and prevent a further 24 million people across 41 developing countries from sliding into poverty. those are staggering and extraordinary figures. they show why it is so important that vaccination is at the top of the uk government ' s agenda for international development. we must not fall into the trap of thinking that health and economy are separate ; in my view, they are inextricably linked. as the harvard evidence shows, a healthy society can evolve to become a wealthy society. i am delighted that uk governments of various colours in the past decades have recognised the value of vaccines. in 2016, the government invested a£116 million of bilateral aid towards vaccination in developing countries.""]"

term plan for apd. there have been a number of reviews of apd ' s efficacy, proportionality and impact on competitiveness since its introduction in 1994, and we need to situate this debate in that context. however, despite those reviews, a number of questions still have not been answered, so i hope the minister provides some indication of the government ' s thinking. as has been indicated in previous debates on this topic, the government estimate that apd contributes about a£3. 1 billion to general taxation. i am well aware that the hon. gentleman and others suggest that, if one takes a holistic view of its fiscal impact, apd may be fiscally positive on the ledger. it would be helpful to hear from the minister whether the treasury is conducting a 360a° review of apd ' s fiscal impact. i understand that pwc has carried out research, but it would help if the treasury were focused on this issue, too. in response to the comments by the hon. member for shannon, i cannot resist -"", ""other right hon. and hon. members will have to make up their minds whether the hon. gentleman is unusual, but i leave that with them. as the hon. member for belfast east pointed out, the tax does not work as an environmental incentive. it is simply an economic disincentive. the money goes into the general tax pool every year and does not go to tackle the environmental issues other than in the way that any other tax might. there is no direct funnelling of that money into environmental initiatives - otherwise there would be significant differences. as he said, all studies show that a reduction in apd would produce a net benefit to the economy. the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) said that pwc stated that if apd is scrapped, the treasury will gain. he made the telling point that a treasury report found that the uk is ranked 135 out of 136 countries in terms the cost to the traveller. that is damning of the cost of air travel through apd. he further pointed out that ireland scrapped apd in 2014 - an independent country making a decision for itself - and tourism shot up by 47 %. the hon. member for belfast east introduced a side issue, which i also thoroughly agree on, of cutting vat rates for tourism. combined with tackling apd, that would be of huge benefit to areas throughout the nations of the uk where tourism and visitor numbers are extremely important to the local economy. we support that strongly and we would commit to it if the power was with us. on the hon. gentleman ' s closing remarks, i cannot send a valentine to the tories because it certainly would not be sincere, but the comment about it being a humorous way to highlight a serious problem is valid."", ""i beg the hon. gentleman ' s pardon. i am very sorry about that. he will perhaps be even more perplexed when i mention that, rather than pound pinching, my family talked about looking after the pennies and the pounds looking after themselves. perhaps that reveals a psychological difference between lowland and ulster scots. of course, we need to look after the pennies and the pounds - that is the whole point. we need to trace exactly the impact of apd. studies suggest that the evidence about apd ' s impact on passenger numbers is mixed. as many members said, such a duty is unusual in the international context, but the number of passengers using uk airports has increased by 15 % - a substantial increase - in the past five years. of course, apd needs to be considered in the context of there being no tax on aviation fuel and no vat on domestic or international flights. there are also different levels of apd for different kinds of flights, and exemptions for children were introduced in 2015 and extended in march 2016. i will focus on four issues : the long - term viability of apd, regional competitiveness, the unequal impact of apd on different groups of britons, and environmental issues. from a revenue point of view, there are clearly significant concerns about apd ' s long - term viability. the government have moved to provide industry with earlier notice of apd changes. the rates for next year were announced last autumn. that is surely positive for industry but, as i mentioned, we have had no indication of the government ' s view of the long - term trajectory of the tax, particularly in the context of the race to the bottom occasioned by internal competition in the uk.""]"

millions of lives have been saved and millions of people treated and restored to good health ; and it has tens of thousands of decent, hard - working and much - loved public sector workers. as we approach the 70th birthday of the national health service, to those workers i say thank you for your compassion and sacrifices, for always going the extra mile and for standing firm in the wake of the millions of tory cuts that we have seen since 2010 and the scottish national party cuts in holyrood since 2007. decisions taken by politicians of all political parties have had an impact on our national health service. i was proud of the previous labour government ' s record investment in our nhs. we delivered lower waiting times, faster operation times, a gp in local communities and vital investment in infrastructure and facilities. sadly, it is not all good, and we cannot take our nhs, its workers or its mission for granted. my local hospital, monklands, serves many of my constituents in coatbridge, chryston and bellshill. it is one of the busiest hospitals, and just a few months ago there were reports that it needed more than a£30 million worth of repairs. there are leaks, and wards are closing. we will look at monklands hospital."", 'i beg to move, that this house has considered recruitment and retention of nhs staff in oxfordshire. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr hollobone. i am delighted to have secured this important debate on the retention and recruitment of nhs staff in oxfordshire. it is a pleasure to see fellow oxfordshire mps in the chamber. since my election last summer, the state of the nhs in our county has been one of the issues that my constituents have raised with me most frequently. i pay tribute to all those who work in the nhs in oxfordshire at every level for their outstanding dedication and commitment to delivering first - class care. we owe it to them, and to patients and their families, to ensure we are providing the best possible service across oxfordshire and, indeed, the country. i am sure all hon. members will agree that the staff do an incredible job, but they are under increasing pressure. some have described the situation as a crisis. although politicians are prone to hyperbole, i fear that that word is increasingly apt. last month, our local nhs hit the headlines nationally, as a leaked memo suggested that oxford university hospitals nhs foundation trust is considering rationing rounds of chemotherapy at the churchill hospital for terminally ill cancer patients because of a 40 % shortfall in the number of specialist nurses needed to deliver care. i spoke with the trust bosses, as i am sure many other hon. members did, and they assured me that the leaked suggestion is not their policy - it is important to reaffirm that point - but they confirmed that it is one option among many being considered by senior staff in the privacy of internal conversations. it is alarming that they are having such conversations at all. that points to a wider issue that needs to be addressed urgently. the problem, of course, goes beyond cancer services at the churchill. i am sure oxfordshire colleagues have their own experiences.', 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr stringer, for the first time, i believe. i congratulate my right hon. friend the member for exeter ( mr bradshaw ) on securing this debate and i thank all other hon. members who have contributed and will contribute. i have to declare many interests in this debate. not only am i a patient of the nhs - not too frequently, i hope - but i also work in the nhs. i began my career as a medical student in 1991 in newcastle and i spent thousands of days working in nhs hospitals, worked for many years as a gp, seen thousands of babies born in the nhs, helped to manage hundreds of good deaths and worked with thousands of colleagues, who are some of the most committed people one could ever hope to meet. my mum worked in the nhs as a nurse. my dad still works in the nhs, managing a practice. my partner works in the nhs and many of my friends work in the nhs. tomorrow morning, i will be doing a gp surgery at the beginning of the day before working in my constituency and ending the day with an mp surgery. my experience has taught me that it is the people who make the nhs, mr stringer. it is not just the ones whom politicians always talk about - doctors, nurses, paramedics and midwives. the nhs has amazing people working as laboratory technicians, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, pharmacists, medical secretaries ; people working in finance, planning, leadership, estates management, catering and cleaning. add to that all the people who work in social care, providing care and support to people in their own homes, and in nursing and residential homes, and we have an army of people all dedicated to health and care. many of the people in that army do not begin their lives in the uk.']"

why should we in this house be so powerless to do anything about it? we need to raise and talk about the issue and make sure that different government departments talk to each other, and then go into the core of why the problem continues. as we have already heard, sex for rent is when a landlord solicits sex - as opposed to currency - in exchange for shelter. many arrangements are informal and thrive in the shadows, taking advantage of young people who do not initially realise that they are doing something that will envelop them in an exploitative situation. i emphasise that the underlying problem of all this is the acute housing shortage. with very high rents, people find themselves unable to find accommodation. there are also more vulnerable people who cannot get on to the social housing ladder and who then find themselves in these arrangements, which ultimately become very exploitative and distressing.', ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr pritchard. i offer my congratulations to my hon. friend the member for hove ( peter kyle ) on securing this debate and thank him for his pioneering campaign in bringing this issue to the attention of the house. rogue landlords are taking advantage of the housing crisis by offering rooms, quite openly, for free in exchange for a€œcompanya€ or a€œbenefitsa€ - or, to put it more bluntly, for sex. frustratingly, despite confirmation from the government that sex for rent is in breach of the sexual offences act 2003, there is little evidence to suggest that any action has yet been taken to punish those preying on innocent victims. i find it unbelievable - despite the government ' s assurances that they are tackling this - that the perpetrators do not even seem to hide what they are doing, and yet there seem to be no arrests. if someone goes online it does not take long to find blatant adverts : a€œfree rooms to spare for women willing to carry out household chores nakeda€anda€œflats to rent, tenants with benefits. must reply with a picture. a€that is illegal. it is sickening exploitation of people who are caught in a spiralling struggle to find the funds to keep a roof over their head, and i ask the minister how it has been allowed to happen without more thorough investigations and prosecutions. action needs to be taken not only against the landlords placing the adverts, who should be prosecuted, but websites such as craigslist, about which we have heard. on the streets, a pimp would be charged for profiting from the sale of sex, so why is this any different?"", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the offence of sex for rent. it is an honour to serve for the first time under your chairmanship, mr pritchard. i am also grateful to the minister for being here. i have known him for a number of years in different capacities, and i know this is a subject that he will have a great deal of interest in. i am grateful to have been granted the debate, because it gives us the chance to highlight a pernicious, exploitative and pervasive phenomenon that too few people are aware of and too little is being done to tackle. the issue of sex for rent was brought to my attention by lauren moss, a bbc journalist. she showed me evidence that people were accepting accommodation from landlords in return for not money, but sex. we do not have to look hard for the adverts. they are not hidden deep in secret corners of online platforms. in fact, one of the most surprising aspects of this is how open and explicit the adverts are, and how integrated they have become into the advertising landscape for accommodation. some adverts simply imply what the landlord is expecting : a€œfree accommodation for attractive femalea€. others are more explicit : a€œyou do not have to pay any rent for your stay with me in exchange for some mutual fun times togethera€. many go into much more detail about how much sex is involved : a€œyou agree sort of like a couple of times a week, pop into my room sort of thing, but as far as the apartment ' s concerned, it ' s like completely as if we ' re flatmates. it ' s all the bills, the rent, free. a€the majority of the ads are aimed at women, but i have also seen them targeting young men.""]"

it disappeared overnight but i will do my best to say what i can before it gives way. there are a number of shisha bars in glasgow. we counted them up in the office and think there are eight, six of which are in my constituency. we even picked up word that there is a shisha - on - wheels delivery service. i am not quite sure where that would fit in current legislation in scotland or in the uk. it is clear that this is a grey area and that more needs to be done. where there are smoke and mirrors, literally, there is potential for criminal enterprise and issues with building regulations, enforcement and the source of the tobacco, which may enter the country illicitly. a friend, qasim hanif, raised a concern that the tobacco is poor quality and does not comply with regulations, which causes health issues additional to those the hon. member for birmingham, ladywood set out. glasgow adopted the scottish government ' s smoking ban in 2006, and it has been spectacularly well complied with ever since. almost 10 years on, it is unthinkable that people used to smoke cigarettes in bars, restaurants, buses, theatres and cinemas. we have moved on so dramatically from that. the outlier of the regulation has been shisha bars. in december 2012 a shisha bar in my constituency was the first to be prosecuted for flouting the smoking ban."", 'i agree with the hon. gentleman. i am glad to see him here because we missed him very much in the adjournment debate last night. i was going to send out a search party to see where he had disappeared to. shisha bars are gaining popularity among young people who do not drink alcohol, either by choice or because of their religion. there is clearly some demand for that type of space where no alcohol is served, because the options in many town and cities are pretty limited. if people want to go out, they are obliged to be in a place where alcohol is being sold and drunk, but that is not necessarily appropriate for everyone. there is a balance to be struck between the social good, where people can come together in an environment where there is no alcohol, and the harm from smoking shishas that the hon. gentleman points out. the perception that smoking shisha is cleaner and better than smoking cigarettes is a very dangerous myth, particularly for young people. the hon. member for birmingham, ladywood pointed out that one session on a shisha can be as bad for your health as smoking 100 cigarettes. that is quite stark. that information needs to be out there and well known. if the government did more to promote the public health message, that might be useful for many of our communities. the tobacco is usually fruit flavoured and slightly different from cigarettes, which can offer a false sense of security that it is not as bad for you, but smoking it doubles the risk of lung cancer and respiratory illness. it also contains all the factors that we know are harmful about tobacco and it is addictive. because of the way that shisha is consumed, people take other chemicals into their lungs from the heating and burning process. it can be more harmful than smoking. in scotland, business owners need to be licensed to sell tobacco, including shisha tobacco.', 'i beg to move, that this house has considered reforming the regulation of shisha lounges. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mrs main. i am delighted to have secured this debate. in a week in which ministers have been held in contempt of parliament for the first time ever, and we have had ongoing and various crises related to the handling of brexit, talking about the regulation of shisha premises might seem a little niche. i have found myself educating many colleagues about what shisha is and about the problems relating to shisha premises in the affected communities. central to this debate is how we as citizens navigate community life together, balancing the social and entertainment needs of some against the needs of residents, and whether we can take effective action when things go wrong. residents affected by issues relating to shisha lounges, such as those in my constituency and other areas including westminster, brent, ealing, preston, manchester and many of our other core cities, can attest to the fact that, when things go wrong, they face the misery of noise nuisance, crime, antisocial behaviour and everything that goes with that. for them, this is definitely not a niche issue. it affects communities profoundly. i should explain what shisha is and what form these premises take. shisha, which is also known as a water pipe, hubble - bubble smoking or a hookah, is a way of smoking tobacco through a bowl and a pipe or a tube. the tobacco is often mixed with other flavours such as mint, coconut or pineapple - i have seen every variety going. the tobacco is burned, and then the vapour or smoke passes through a water basin before inhalation. it is a social activity ; people do it in groups.']"

let accommodation and, in the case of holiday - let accommodation, properties are assessed for business rates, rather than council tax, if they are available for short - term lets for 140 days or more per financial year. any property registered for business rates may qualify and, indeed, is likely to qualify today for small business rate relief. concerns have been expressed by many local authorities and hon. members, including the hon. member for westmorland and lonsdale and the right hon. member for north norfolk ( norman lamb ), that some second home owners may be exploiting what has been termed a loophole to reduce their local tax liability by declaring that a property is available for let, but making little realistic effort to let it out, potentially giving them access to small business rate relief and thereby meaning that they pay no rates or council tax whatever. it is only right that genuine holiday -
