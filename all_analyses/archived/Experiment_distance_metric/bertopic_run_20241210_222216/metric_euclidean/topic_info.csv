i look to the minister and offer my humble opinion that we should strengthen the law so that no one can feel that this is a grey area any more, as the hon. member for bath mentioned in her intervention. let us in this debate, with a statement from the minister, and more generally from the house, make this a black - and - white issue and keep men and women from being exploited in this way. in northern ireland, we have sought to address issues such as this through the human trafficking and exploitation ( criminal justice and support for victims ) act ( northern ireland ) 2015. the legislation was brought forward in the northern ireland assembly by my colleague in the other place, lord morrow. the minister will be aware of this as part of the background to the issue, and i hope others are also aware of it, but northern ireland became the first part of the united kingdom to make paying for sex a crime, when the legislation came into effect in june 2015. anyone caught breaking the law can be jailed for up to a year and face a a£1, 000 fine. that is the sort of legislation that we need here ; it is the sort of legislation that the hon. members for bath and for hove, and indeed every one of us in the debate, would wish to see in place. let me give an idea of what can be achieved with such a law. i should say first that allegations may be made, but an evidential base has to be there as well.', ""the right hon. lady poses an ingenious question. the simple answer is that the form of the arrangements with the european union after our exit is the subject of the negotiations. the government have committed to holding a meaningful vote on the deal. the focus will be on whether the deal is appropriate, not on secondary legislation within this legislation. this bill is designed to facilitate whatever the will of parliament ends up being. that is the important point. the government have been clear from the outset of the negotiations that, as we implement the decision of the british people to leave the eu at the end of march 2019, we want a deep and special partnership with the european union and that, as we move towards any future relationship, we should seek to minimise disruption and maximise the opportunities that the process of withdrawal represents. that is in the interests of businesses and individuals in the uk and the eu. since triggering article 50, the government have worked intensively with our european partners to settle the issues in the first phase of the negotiations - namely, a fair deal on citizens ' rights allowing uk and eu citizens to get on with their lives in the country in which they live ; a financial settlement that honours the commitments that the uk has undertaken as a member of the european union, just as we said we would ; and an agreement on the island of ireland that preserves the territorial integrity of the united kingdom and the stability that has been brought about by the belfast agreement. we have made great strides in each of those three areas, and i am sure that members on both sides of the house will welcome the european council ' s agreement last month that sufficient progress had been made on phase 1 and that we should move on to talks about our future partnership. this development in the negotiations means that we can now look forward to discussing our future customs relationship with the eu.""]"

but much more needs to be done. we are working alongside transport for the north, northern, trans pennine express and network rail on improving services and punctuality. we have asked richard george to review the performance of the region ' s rail network and to make recommendations to improve reliability, and where operators are found to be at fault, we will take action."", 'i will make some progress before i give way again. i would like to update the house on how the industry is working to improve the reliability of services. on 4 june, northern introduced a temporary timetable, including a targeted reduction in trains by around 6 % to achieve a more deliverable service. even with this reduction in service, there are still more trains running across the whole northern network than before the timetable change in may. that does not mean that there are not individual areas that still have very significant problems, and i am very conscious that many passengers are still experiencing significant disruption, but there are signs that the service is stabilising. over the first two weeks of the reduced timetable, 80 % of trains arrived on time and 4 % were cancelled or arrived significantly late, which is a significant improvement. this is not nearly good enough, but it is an improvement on what was happening before the introduction of that timetable. northern is planning to run the timetable until the end of july, when it will review and, we hope, significantly increase the number of trains running, while ensuring continued stability. stability is the most important thing for passengers so that they know what is expected, when trains are going to come and that they are going to come. officials from the rail north partnership - it is worth reminding labour members that this franchise is managed as a partnership between my department and the leaders of local authorities in the north. decisions about it are taken by the partnership board of transport for the north, and it has been considering how to respond - the shadow secretary of state says it does not exist. this is the most devolved franchise in england. responsibilities for managing and overseeing the franchise are shared through the board of transport for the north - labour members do not like it, but that is the truth. gtr is also working to increase the predictability and reliability of journeys on its network.']"

reforming the plan - making system to ensure that every part of the country produces, maintains and implements an up - to - date plan ; and an opportunity for local authorities to have their five - year housing land supply agreed on an annual basis. the last two points are particularly relevant to today ' s important debate. it is important that local authorities plan effectively for the new housing required in their areas. ultimately, new homes need to be provided through up - to - date local plans, produced in consultation with local people and communities. these are a vital element of the planning system. they are the starting point for planning decisions by planning authorities and inspectors. i welcome the progress that babergh district council, working with mid suffolk district council, has made with their local plan preparations."", 'the hon. lady will be aware of the borrowing cap issue and how we have made changes around that, and i also gently point out that when her party was in power house building starts fell by 45 % in 12 years and the number of homes purchased in england fell by over 40 %. i make that point to underline that there are challenges that have existed for many years under a number of different governments, and that is why this government are determined to make progress and address the key issues that i have highlighted. first, on planning and build - out, this government recently set out a bold and comprehensive approach via our new national planning policy framework. this will help us to build more high - quality homes in the places people want to live. the consultation recently closed and my department is looking carefully at the responses we received. the framework implements reforms from the housing white paper and further steps announced at the budget. it also strengthens our commitment to protect the green belt. our framework makes it clear that local authorities must pursue all options, such as brownfield land and increasing density on urban sites, before looking to the green belt. alongside this, we have announced our intention to consult on a permitted development right to build upwards. the framework also clarifies how our new method of assessing housing need will work. it will help all communities to have a clear understanding of the homes they need while maintaining the importance of local and neighbourhood plans. planning permissions are up. that is good news, but a planning permission is not helpful if it is not turned into a home. that is why our housing delivery test is tackling unjustified delays in housing delivery. local authorities must be accountable to make sure that homes in their area are not only planned but delivered.', ""it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for grantham and stamford ( nick boles ), although i did not agree with everything he said. he and i know each other very well, and it is good to see him back in the house. we constantly hear the same lines about the government promising to fix the housing market, yet after their seven years in government, it is no secret that we still have an enormous housing crisis in this country. last year, the number of affordable homes built in this country fell to the lowest level in 24 years. new policies introduced by this government have weakened the previous labour government ' s brownfield - first policy. in fact, under this government, as of july 2017, 425, 000 homes were planned to be built on green - belt land. that represents the biggest yearly increase in proposed development on green - belt land for two decades. to add insult to injury, since 2009, only 16 % of houses built on green - belt land outside local plans were deemed affordable. it is worth pointing out that under the previous labour government, 2 million more homes were built and we had 1 million more householders owning their own homes, but since 2010, under this government, the number of homeowners aged under 45 has fallen by 900, 000. there was also the biggest investment in social housing for a generation. on average, labour councils have built around 50 % more homes than tory councils since 2010. it is clear that the government ' s housing and planning act 2016 fails to get to grips with the crisis of home ownership. it is simply no good trying to twist this around and placing the blame on those in local government. if that were true, coventry ' s local plan would not have been approved by this government.""]"

80 % of disability - related poverty is because of the additional costs that disabled people face by virtue of their disability, and these have been estimated at a£570 a month on average. the cuts to social security mean that more and more disabled people are becoming isolated in their own home as their mobility vehicles or personal support are taken from them. many are struggling to pay their rent or mortgage. their health conditions have deteriorated and other conditions have developed, including mental health conditions, as they face the relentless stress and anxiety resulting from a social security system that is hostile, unsupportive and even dehumanising. the sanctions regime that has affected over 1 million disabled people since 2010, the work capability assessment and personal independence payment assessment processes are all part of this. quite frankly, it is grotesque that people with progressive conditions such as motor neurone disease have, until last month, been habitually forced through the personal independence payment assessment process.', 'i have lots to get through. i want the hon. member for central ayrshire to reply, and the scottish national party has had a lot to say today. the hon. lady majored fairly heavily on disability benefits in her speech. we are committed to ensuring that more of the money goes to the people who need it most. we have continued to increase benefits for people with disabilities and health conditions, and we will spend a£800 million extra in 2018 - 19 to do that once again. for people in the employment and support allowance support group, that means a£720 more per year than in 2010. for recipients of the monthly rate of disability living allowance, paid to the most disabled children, it is more than a£1, 200 a year more. at the same time, we are determined to break down the barriers to employment faced by disabled people. the hon. lady spoke about the removal of the work - related activity component under esa. the old system, as we all remember, was failing to help disabled people and those with health conditions into work. only one in 100 esa work - related activity group claimants leave the benefit each month. we believe that disabled people and people with health conditions deserve better than that. we believe that the changes, working in tandem with a a£330 million support package over the next four years, will provide the right incentives and support to help new claimants with limited capability for work. taken as a whole, our policies to help people with disabilities to find employment have been making good progress. more than half a million more disabled people are now in work than four years ago, and on a before - housing - costs basis the absolute poverty rate among people living in a family where somebody is disabled is now down to a record low. on the underpayment of esa, the hon.', ""let me begin by congratulating the hon. member for east kilbride, strathaven and lesmahagow ( dr cameron ) on securing this important and timely debate. i commend her for the work she has led on the all - party parliamentary group for disability. i would like to extend my thanks to a number of disability organisations, including disability rights uk, the royal national institute of blind people, scope, leonard cheshire disability and action on hearing loss, for all the work they have done on improving employment opportunities for disabled people and for the important briefings they have provided for today ' s very important debate. there are currently around 11. 6 million disabled people in this country - people like me, who have factors that could act as a barrier to engaging in a wide range of valued activities, and not just economic activity, which is the focus of our debate. disabled people make up around 16 % of the working - age population, yet we face barriers in all aspects of life, including in education, transport, access to justice, access to voting, housing, health and, most importantly, employment. almost eight years of tory austerity have had a disproportionate impact on disabled people. we know that half of those who live in poverty are disabled or live with someone who is disabled, in part because of the additional cost of their disability, but also because the labour market does not work well for disabled people who are able to work. the duty to make reasonable adjustments to support disabled people in accessing education, employment, housing, and goods and services is a key feature of the equality act 2010.""]"
5,795,5_prison_prisons_prisoners_probation,"['prison', 'prisons', 'prisoners', 'probation', 'reoffending', 'officers', 'offenders', 'rehabilitation', 'hmp', 'sentences']","['bearing in mind your warning, mr speaker, i will try to deal with those four quite different questions briefly, but they are serious questions that are worth spending a little time on. the question about numbers is a good one. during the previous labour government, the number of people in prison rose from about 40, 000 to nearly 80, 000 - the prison population nearly doubled - so we inherited a prison estate with an enormous number of prisoners. that involves a serious conversation right across the house about the number of people we wish to put in prison, and that goes beyond this question about bedford. however, we will undertake to look carefully at the population of bedford prison and at the ratio between prison officers and prisoners, and we will come back within 28 days to the chief inspector of prisons with an answer laying out a plan. the second question is on the building at bedford, which of course dates from the early 1800s, as the hon. gentleman said. although we have a new wing in place, a lot of the physical infrastructure is very difficult, which is unfortunately true not only of bedford. a third of the current prison estate was built before 1900 - these are victorian prisons - which is why we will be spending the money to create 10, 000 new prison places with modern accommodation. there is a very clear relationship between old buildings and this type of problem, and only new investment and new builds will solve it. on recruitment and retention, bedford has, as the hon. gentleman knows, quite a challenging job market. wages have been rising, employment figures are quite high and bedford is relatively close to the commuter belt, which means we have had some struggle recruiting and retaining. we now have 3, 500 more prison officers in place than we had in 2015. we need to invest more in training them, and we need to invest more in making sure they stay. the hon.', 'this is an historic opportunity. i think that this is the first time in more than 200 years of our prison service that we have had an individual prison debated on the floor of the house. i pay tribute to the justice committee for bringing the matter forward. the situation in liverpool prison was, as the chairman of the select committee has pointed out, genuinely shocking. it is very disturbing and it is unbelievably important that select committees, inspectors and members of parliament hold us accountable for prisoners. these are closed communities. they are often hidden away from the public. in many areas, they can be forgotten, and without scrutiny standards can drop. they dropped very seriously in liverpool prison. the condition in the cells was unacceptable ; how prisoners were treated was unacceptable, and the lack of purposeful activity was unacceptable. we are now addressing this hard and quickly, but there are still huge lessons to be learned through the system. i pay tribute to the new governor, pia sinha, who has come in, taken cells out of commission and made it clear that she has cleaned the prison and that her objective over the next six months is to get those cells into a smart, good condition. we now have the money in place to put in the new windows and she is focused on ensuring that the education and employment activity is good. more generally, there are lessons right the way through the prison system. we need to get the basics right. there is no point talking about rehabilitation or dealing with reoffending unless we have clean, decent and safe spaces for all prisoners. we want our prisons to be smart and well - functioning. we are bringing in more than 2, 000 more prison officers, and that will relieve some of the pressures on the prison estate, but these are new prison officers and will need training and support until they have the prisoncraft to deliver what we require.', 'it is 100 % in the public interest to prosecute prisoners who assault prisoner officers. if they are not prosecuted, the authority of the state is undermined ; it becomes almost impossible for prison officers to run a decent and human regime, very difficult for people to be unlocked from their cells and difficult to move people into education and purposeful activity. if the education and purposeful activity and the decent and safe environment of the prisoner are not delivered, the prisoner is much more likely to reoffend when they leave that prison. that is a direct threat to public safety ; therefore, as my hon. friend implies, the crown prosecution service must prosecute prisoners for attacking prisoner officers. we owe that to prison officers, but we also owe it to the public as a whole to have safe, clean and decent prisons. these are our prisons ;

of people throwing things into prisons by the use of nets and proper yard searching ; of people dragging things into prison by identifying the wire set - ups that run into prison windows ; and of people posting things into prison - for example, a letter impregnated with spice so it can be smoked can be photocopied.']"

in - law to breast cancer. that is one of the reasons why i joined the all - party parliamentary group on breast cancer, and i am vice - chair of the group to this day. it is this emotion that encourages us and gets us all to come together to tackle cancer. over the years, there has been a steady improvement in cancer survival rates in england. however, we still lag behind the improvements of our european counterparts, and the number of new cancer cases continues to rise year on year. if these trends continue, it is estimated that by 2020 some 2. 4 million people in england will have had a cancer diagnosis at some point in their life. that is why the government must take urgent steps so that cancer diagnosis care and outcomes in england can be improved. the cancer strategy was a welcome step forward to achieving the best cancer care and outcomes in the world, and labour is fully committed to delivering, and helping to deliver, that strategy in full. however, as has been mentioned, there are some concerns across the house about the progress of the strategy. i am pleased that some of the targets have already been met, but i am under no illusions - many are no closer to being reached than they were almost three years ago.', 'it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for bosworth ( david tredinnick ), who made an interesting speech. i also thank the hon. member for east kilbride, strathaven and lesmahagow ( dr cameron ) for securing this important debate. we all know someone who has had, or has been affected by, cancer. my family is no exception : both my parents had cancer and my husband lives with cancer every day of his life, and i could talk about cancer forever - but, madam deputy speaker, i will try to limit myself to the recommended time. the cancer strategy sets out strategic priorities and recommendations that aim to improve radically the outcomes that the nhs delivers for people affected by cancer, yet we also know that the specific needs of blood cancer patients are not being fully met by the cancer strategy. that is primarily because the experience of blood cancer patients is different from that of solid tumour cancer patients, so general cancer services are not always effective in meeting their needs. these unmet needs occur in a number of priority areas identified in the cancer strategy, including awareness and early diagnosis, patient experience, living with and beyond cancer, access to new treatments and research, and nhs commissioning. today, i want to focus on one particular issue : the need to improve post stem cell transplant care for blood cancer patients. this issue overlaps with a number of the aforementioned priority areas : patient experience, living with and beyond cancer, and nhs commissioning. it is estimated that by 2020 there will be more than 16, 000 people in the uk living post transplant, many of whom will be experiencing both physical and psychological side - effects from their treatment which can last for months or even years. the side - effects can include graft versus host disease, second cancers, infertility, depression, isolation and post - traumatic stress disorder.']"

and this is the issue i wish to raise in today ' s debate - relates to what happens when someone has the good news that they have been granted refugee status. it is deeply concerning that even once asylum is granted, many refugees continue to experience homelessness and hardship. the homelessness charity crisis reported that in 2016 - 17, 478 people - 7 % of those who approached it for help - had nowhere to live after leaving asylum accommodation. that was more than double the number in 2014 - 15. in a sample of night shelters over the winter of 2017 -

eileanan an iar. last year, only 794 children who arrived in the uk as unaccompanied children were granted asylum. the bill seeks to help those 794 children - that figure is less than the number of peers in the other place -

it is a humanitarian catastrophe. since august 2017, nearly 680, 000 rohingya refugees have sought shelter in bangladesh. there have been some suggestions, including by the foreign affairs committee, that the uk failed to see this crisis coming. with respect, i disagree with such a conclusion. let us be clear about what has led to this current situation. the rohingya have suffered persecution in rakhine for decades. such rights as they had have been progressively diminished under successive military governments. they have been victims of systematic violence before, most recently in 2012 and in late 2016. on these more recent occasions, the rohingya fled their homes - some to internally displaced person camps elsewhere in rakhine, and some to other nations over land or sea. the outbreak of vicious hostility during the past six months is therefore only the latest episode in a long - lasting cycle of violence. we have been urging the burmese civilian government to take action to stop the situation deteriorating since they came to power two years ago. what was unprecedented and unforeseen about this most recent violence was its scale and intensity.""]"

taxpayers should not, and will not, bail out a private sector company for private sector losses or allow rewards for failure. i fully understand that both members of the public and particularly employees of companies in the carillion group will have concerns at this time, and the government are doing everything possible to minimise any impact on employees. let me be clear that all employees should continue to turn up to work confident in the knowledge that they will be paid for the public services they are providing. additionally, in order to support staff - and in this instance this will apply to staff working for the private sector as well as for the public sector contracts of the carillion group - we have established a helpline using jobcentre plus through its rapid response service. the government are also doing everything they can to minimise the impact on subcontractors and suppliers who, like employees, will continue to be paid through the official receiver. the action we have taken is designed to keep vital public services running, rather than to provide a bail - out on the failure of a commercial company. the role of the government is to plan and prepare for the continuing delivery of public services that are dependent on these contracts, and that is what we have done."", ""as i have already said to the house, these are not political appointments so there is no political intervention in them. it is quite right that donations to all political parties are made public. that is what the house has voted for and embodied in legislation, and it makes the situation clear to everybody. let me turn to carillion ' s liquidation. along with all my fellow ministers and, i believe, the whole house, i recognise that the collapse of carillion has caused huge anxiety for the people who work for carillion companies, the people in carillion pension schemes, the suppliers and subcontractors and, of course, the people who use the public services provided by the company ' s workers. i reiterate the priorities that have animated the government throughout the process. they have been : first, to make sure that public service delivery continued without interruption, which has been the case, as no public bodies have reported any major service disruptions ; secondly, to reassure the workers employed on public service contracts that they will continue to get paid for their work ; thirdly, to make sure that the right support is in place for pensioners ; and fourthly, to protect taxpayers from an unacceptable bail - out of a public company, the risk of which is rightly borne by the shareholders and the banks that have lent to it. the situation today is that the official receiver is now effectively running carillion, and in the course of time his investigations will show exactly how the company ran into trouble. although carillion was under some financial pressure from three uk public sector construction projects - two hospitals and a road scheme in scotland - it is already clear from the company ' s statements to the stock market and from information that has become public since the liquidation that the problems it faced lay largely in its overseas construction projects and in the level of financial risk that it took on."", ""that is the point the hon. lady made in her speech. let us be clear : carillion is in insolvency, not in administration - there is a distinct difference in law. while the government have stood behind carillion to ensure that those public services continue to be delivered by the company during that smooth transition, in law, carillion is in insolvency. i commend the hon. lady on her italian, but the point she makes is not relevant to the carillion case, unfortunately. later in my speech, i will explain why tupe does not apply in this case. the new company that i referred to, the gov co from the ministry of justice, will ensure the delivery of, for example, prison facilities management previously provided by carillion, including things such as cleaning, reactive maintenance, landscaping and planned repair building work. those jobs have been taken in house to a gov co. we have also seen positive signs regarding carillion ' s larger contracts. as i said, a number of jobs have already been secured, but, as hon. members will have seen, the media have recently reported on serco ' s and brookfield ' s interest in purchasing a number of contracts and transferring roughly 4, 000 workers, although that is not yet confirmed. i understand that the official receiver and the special managers are working hard with customers to try to secure agreements, which will secure further jobs. we also have to remember that some of these contracts are in the private sector and some are in the public sector. the government were a customer of carillion. we did not own carillion. my hon. friend the member for stirling ( stephen kerr ) rightly pointed out that we did not ride to the rescue and bail carillion out.""]"

i do not think there will ever be one simple solution. the amount of plastic entering our seas is now a matter of huge concern for many people. as is well documented, it is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans. that is of concern not only because of the damage it is doing to the marine environment, but because that pollution is being ingested by humans as we eat the fish from the sea. we should really take the issue seriously and seek to address it. it is right to acknowledge the steps the government have already taken in reducing the amount of plastic pollution. it is well documented that the 5p plastic bag charge, introduced by the previous conservative - led government, has dramatically reduced the amount of plastic bags in use : by 83 %. about 9 billion fewer plastic bags have been used since the introduction of that simple 5p charge. the government have brought forward a comprehensive 25 - year plan for the environment, including measures to look at reducing plastic waste and disposing of waste more responsibly. that should be welcomed. i want to join the many environmental groups that are calling for an introduction of plastic - free aisles and products in our supermarkets.', ""the reality is that until now, china, turkey, malaysia, indonesia, vietnam and other countries have largely been happy to accept our plastic because they have seen it as a raw material that they can use to generate more products. plastic recycling is technically possible and exists in this country already - it is just that it is not as economical. people have to pay to recycle various sources of plastic rather than getting a benefit from them, although that is changing. we recognise that china has reduced the amount of contamination that it is prepared to accept in plastic - it does not ignore all plastic, but effectively it has closed the market and made it less worth while. i am sure my hon. friend is eagerly awaiting our strategy on resources and waste, which will appear in due course. perhaps more can be revealed at that time. i mentioned the measures in the 25 - year environment plan we published in january, as well as the government ' s commitment to taking action against the problem of single - use plastics waste as part of our wider strategy. we have given a£20 million to the plastics innovation fund, which is co - ordinated by innovate uk and the engineering and physical sciences research council, and which aims to reduce the environmental costs of plastic and litter. i am pleased to say that, in the budget, we announced not only a tax on plastic products that are not at least 30 % recycled, but a further a£20 million of funding : a£10 million extra for r & d and a£10 million to pioneer innovative approaches to boosting recycling and reducing litter. the fund will be made available during the 2019 - 20 financial year. i agree with my hon. friend the member for north cornwall that innovation is vital in supporting developments to tackle plastic waste, so we will continue to explore commercially viable options.""]"

by and large, these are very straightforward claims. we want to ensure that support is there so that people are able to bring the claims in person. as i have said, these are simple claims and it is right that we also take action to address some of the concerns that we have. i shall set out more detail in my remarks, but i believe that we have the balance right in terms of the increase to a£5, 000. the bill provides that the tariff will be set in regulations to be debated via the affirmative procedure by parliament following royal assent. we are committed to tabling an amendment in committee that will require the lord chancellor to consult with the lord chief justice before making those regulations. the judiciary will have discretion to increase the compensation payable in exceptional circumstances and, after listening to the views in the other place, we have amended the bill to ensure that overall compensation levels in the tariff are reviewed at least every three years. we listened carefully to the comments made by the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee in the lords. we accepted its recommendation and tabled an amendment to include a full definition of whiplash injury in the bill in order to remove any ambiguity about what that constitutes in law. the government ' s reform programme also includes measures - not included in the scope of this bill - to increase the small claims track limit for road traffic accident personal injury claims to a£5, 000, and for all other personal injury claims to a£2, 000. as these claims are generally not complicated, they are suitable to be managed in the simpler, lower cost small claims track. this route is designed to be accessible to litigants in person without the need for a lawyer, although claimants may still seek legal representation if they wish."", 'it is a pleasure to be able to speak in this debate on the second reading of the civil liability bill, which brings forward changes that are of great importance to the insurance industry. i am pleased to hear that there has been significant engagement between industry and government over this essential legislation. ageas insurance, for example, is one of the largest providers in the uk, employing more than 400 people in my constituency, and it has communicated to me its enthusiastic support for these changes, shared by the vast majority of the public. these measures will help to reduce motor insurance premiums for insurance customers by adjusting how the personal injury discount rate is set. alongside this, the introduction of a new tariff will specifically target exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims that have driven up insurance premiums for hard - working households in places such as stoke - on - trent. a new fixed compensation level for whiplash injury will be created, putting provisions in place for the court to uplift the compensation available in exceptional circumstances, compared with a final compensation figure being negotiated by the parties involved, as is currently the case. the compensation culture that has been created, with huge levels of unjustified claims for things like whiplash, saw premiums rise at the fastest rate ever last year. increases of about 10 % a year are totally unmanageable and unaffordable for motorists. these changes must be brought about to reduce the price all motorists are having to pay to compensate unreasonably high levels of claims. clearly, it is important that these savings are passed on to consumers. i am pleased to hear that the abi, which represents 93 % of the motor insurance market, has written to the lord chancellor emphasising its commitment to this.', 'my hon. friend is right to raise both points. i come back to the fact that the cma looked at this area and concluded that this is a competitive one. the history suggests that these benefits are passed on, but we are strengthening the bill and will bring forward amendments very shortly that will enable us all to hold those insurance companies to account. many claims involving road traffic accidents will, of course, be genuine. it is absolutely right that they are compensated appropriately. our reforms are focused on ensuring that genuine claimants have access to justice, receive a proportionate amount of compensation and that the system works for all who use it honestly. however, with major improvements in motoring safety in recent years, including the increased use of integrated seat and head restraints, it would be remiss of the government not to ask what is going wrong. the reality is that some of these claims are not genuine. in 2017, the insurance industry identified almost 70, 000 motor insurance claims that it considered to be fraudulent. as the learned lord hope of craighead noted in the other place, it is necessary to do something to try to minimise the abuse that has given rise to such a large and disproportionate number of claims. the knock - on effect of all these claims is increased insurance premiums, particularly for young people and the elderly. as members across the house will know, for many people, owning a car is not a luxury, but a necessity. that is especially true of those in rural communities, but it does affect all our constituents. that is why we have pledged in our manifesto to tackle these costs. taken together, the whiplash measures proposed by the government could result in savings of around a£1. 1 billion a year. around 85 % of the uk motor and liability insurance market have publicly committed to pass on those savings to consumers.']"

to - day basis. the overriding purpose of the legislation is to help to shift the balance of power from unscrupulous agents and landlords towards decent tenants - to make renting fairer, more affordable and more transparent and to give tenants greater clarity and control over what they pay. we will all have heard horror stories of agents or landlords charging people excessive fees to secure properties, or throughout tenancies, imposing additional charges with excessively high administration fees. with fewer social properties available, this places great difficulties on those with low incomes, or those who are renting alone or simply cannot afford thousands of pounds in up -

income families. i support the broad aims of this bill, but i would like to draw the government ' s attention to one aspect that continues to leave tenants vulnerable to unfair fees. i have particular concern with schedule 1 ( 4 ), which reserves the right for landlords and letting agents to charge tenants who are forced to default on their tenancy agreements. i believe people who rent through the private sector could be better supported by this part of the bill. i understand that some agents and landlords currently charge a full month ' s rent for tenants to be granted an early release, then every month ' s rent and utilities while a new tenant is found. there are genuine instances where tenants are forced to end tenancy agreements, which they entered into in good faith, through absolutely no fault of their own : for someone living in the private rented sector who is made redundant from their job, benefits might not cover the rent, and any delays in receiving benefits will leave them in rent arrears. someone might have had a family bereavement and might need to move to another part of the country or of the world.""]"

saving heart surgery to palestinian children and training palestinian doctors, who will return to gaza where they will be able to perform the surgery themselves."", 'it is a great pleasure to speak in this very important debate. i congratulate my hon. friend the member for sheffield, heeley ( louise haigh ) on securing it. i do not want to repeat the statistics that have already been referred to, but i think that we need to look dispassionately at the evidence of the unfolding catastrophe that we are witnessing in gaza. i would like to echo the comments of other members. my experience when i was part of a delegation to the occupied territories was that we were not able to effect entry into gaza. i appeal to the minister to try to make representations to the israeli government to ensure that that is possible. according to oxfam, at least 80 % of the population in gaza rely on humanitarian aid to survive. it is clear that many - in fact, nearly all - of the key industries were destroyed during the three military interventions, and as a consequence more than 60 % of gazan youth are unemployed. i understand that that is the highest rate in the world. my right hon. friend the member for enfield north ( joan ryan ) referred to the actions of hamas. clearly, opposition members and, i think, members across the whole house condemn violent actions. in truth, the gaza blockade began long before hamas came to power in gaza. i remind my right hon. and hon. friends that it started with israel cancelling the general exit permit out of the gaza strip in 1991. to suggest that the current situation in gaza is down to hamas alone does not fit into the facts or the realities on the ground. gaza has been accurately described as a vast open prison, a strip of territory hermetically sealed from the outside world by israel and egypt. since 2007, israel has repeatedly attacked fisherman off the gazan coast.', 'i beg to move, that this house has considered the humanitarian situation in gaza. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir henry. i place on record my thanks to the chairman of ways and means, who allowed this debate to be facilitated before the house goes into recess. the situation in gaza for its 1. 8 million residents is nothing short of inhumane, but before i turn to some of the specific concerns of many in gaza and the wider palestinian community, i want to comment briefly on the events of the last two months, which cannot possibly be divorced from the broader realities facing palestinians. the brutal response to the protests on the gaza border during the last two months are a mark of shame on a deadlocked international community, giving succour to an israeli government acting with a lethal culture of impunity. that, i am afraid, has been exacerbated by the feeble response of our own government, whose voice carries weight yet has been barely audible, and of course by the disgraceful comments and actions of president trump. the violence at the gaza border since 30 march has been truly shocking : 112 palestinians have been killed, 13, 000 have been injured - 3, 500 of them with live ammunition - and 13 children have been killed. one israeli soldier has been injured. before i go any further, i want to acknowledge explicitly the responsibility of hamas in stoking the protests and provoking israel. hamas is a terrorist organisation that refuses to recognise the right of israel to exist, and israel has a right to defend itself. as an occupying force, however, israel must be held accountable for its actions and the attacks on protestors. it is vital for the credibility of the international system that there is an urgent, independent, un - led investigation into these grave violations of international law.']"

the government clearly recognise the flaws in their argument. when pushed, they claim that voter identification is designed to tackle the perception of electoral fraud. however, new research published today by the electoral reform society shows that mandatory id in polling stations is one of voters ' lowest concerns - just 4 % of voters believe id is the most important priority for our democracy. the top issues for voters were : ensuring that elections are free from the influence of large financial donations, an accurate voting register and balanced media coverage."", ""the british public deserve to have confidence in our democracy. there is clearly the potential for electoral fraud in our system and that undermines confidence and promotes perceptions of vulnerability. when fraud is committed in elections, it is not a victimless crime ; people ' s votes are stolen or someone is elected who should not have been elected. earlier this year, the government announced that they would be conducting pilots for voter identification at the local elections in may this year in line with our manifesto commitment to legislate to ensure that a form of id must be presented before voting. voter id is part of the government ' s commitment to improve the security and the resilience of the electoral system that underpins our democracy and will promote greater confidence in our democratic processes. in making these changes, we will bring our electoral system in line with others such as that in northern ireland or canada, which operate successful programmes, and recognise that there is an increasing expectation that someone ' s vote should be protected and carefully guarded. we already ask that people prove who they are in order to claim benefits, to rent a car or even to collect a parcel from the post office, so this is a proportionate and reasonable approach. democracy is precious and it is right to take that more robust approach to protect the integrity of the electoral process. the independent electoral commission has, since 2014, pushed for the introduction of id to strengthen the system, and it has welcomed the voter id pilots as a positive first step towards implementing its own recommendation that an accessible, proportionate voter identification scheme should be introduced in great britain. in a recent report for democratic audit uk, academic stuart wilks - heeg stated that, after the scheme was introduced in northern ireland, there was no evidence to suggest a fall in turnout, but that there was plenty of evidence that fraud declined sharply.""]"

have we witnessed or heard reports of such behaviour by others but failed to act? how, collectively and individually, do we change behaviours and, most importantly, the culture in this place? it is barely three months since the house put in place the independent complaints and grievance scheme, which is aimed at tackling bullying, harassment and sexual harassment. while dame laura cox acknowledges that the new process contains much that is of value - i commend the leader of the house and her steering group for their efforts and determination in introducing the new scheme three months ago - she makes such fundamental criticisms of it that the house will have to revisit aspects of the scheme. indeed, the house of commons commission has moved quickly to accept her three key recommendations : that the valuing others and respect policies should be scrapped ; that complaints relating to historical allegations should be heard ; and that complaints by house of commons staff against members of the house should be determined througha€œan entirely independent process, in which members of parliament will play no parta€. this gives rise to detailed questions about implementation, and about ownership and responsibility for driving forward the recommendations for the implementation of the cox report."", ""thank you, mr deputy speaker, for giving me the opportunity to say a few words on behalf of the house of commons commission. i also thank dame laura cox for her report on the bullying and harassment of commons staff. the commission recognises that it has a statutory responsibility for the employment of house staff, but too often has failed in its duty to provide a workplace free from bullying and harassment. the report described an institutional failure to address a problem that has undermined the legitimacy and authority of the house. as others have said, bullying and harassment have no place in the house or in any other area of public life. the commission is determined to take immediate steps to rectify past mistakes and offer robust protection and support to all who work here. as members will know, the commission met on wednesday 24 october to discuss the report ' s recommendations and consider a way forward. members of the commission, including the clerk of the house and the director general, were unanimous in recognising that it is time for a change, and agreed to the three fundamental recommendations in dame laura ' s report. this decision was reinforced at a further meeting on monday 29 october. we agreed to terminate the valuing others policy and the respect policy, to expand the new independent complaints and grievance scheme to enable house employees with historic allegations to access it - although we have heard the leader of the house point out that that is available to them already - and to ensure that the process for determining complaints of bullying, harassment or sexual harassment brought by house staff against members of parliament is an entirely independent process in which members play no part. work will start on this immediately with the leader of the house and with input from the chair of the standards committee and the parliamentary commissioner for standards - the widest scheme possible, perhaps in the way the hon. member for rhondda ( chris bryant ) was asking for earlier.""]"

i understand the exceptional circumstances of this fire, but the fire and emergency services must be staffed, resourced and paid adequately to ensure they are sufficiently prepared for any emergency. they should not be expected to react on a shoestring budget. the effect on staffing levels of budgetary cuts over the past eight years is clear. since 2010, greater manchester and lancashire between them have had around 1, 000 firefighters cut. will the minister acknowledge the failure of austerity and take a lead from labour ' s commitment to recruit 3, 000 new firefighters and to scrap the pay cap?"", 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr hosie. i congratulate my hon. friend the member for north tyneside ( mary glindon ) on securing this timely and important debate. i put on record my thanks to the brave firefighters, not only in tyne and wear but across the country. we saw in the dreadful grenfell disaster how, as members of the public run to get out of burning, dangerous, blazing buildings, firefighters run in to those buildings in an attempt to save lives. this debate is not only about the fire service and public service ; it is about firefighters. the gratitude that this government have shown to firefighters for the service that they give for the people of this country, by cutting their salaries by a£7, 000 and making them work longer for their pensions, is a disgrace. tyne and wear integrated risk management plan has been brought about because of austerity. as we know now, austerity is a political choice, not an economic necessity. it is a political choice that has brought about a a£25 million cut in resources to tyne and wear fire authority since 2010, with a further a£3. 5 million in the pipeline. by 2020, almost 20 % will have come out of the fire authority budget in tyne and wear. that means that we have 300 fewer firefighters than we had in 2010, with a cut of a further 70 in the pipeline. we have seen fire station closures ; we have seen fire engines scrapped and numerous pieces of emergency rescue equipment put out of operation. what does it mean for what is, at the end of the day, a public service? it has meant a reduction in response times of two minutes per call, which will worsen by a further 20 seconds. as any firefighter knows, extra seconds cost lives.', 'i beg to move, that this house has considered the proposed new integrated risk management plan for tyne and wear fire and rescue service. it is an honour to serve under your chairmanship, mr hosie. judging by the attendance of right hon. and hon. friends from tyne and wear and neighbouring constituencies, this debate demonstrates the importance of a good fire service, which is essential to our lives, our communities and the industries and services that we rely on. i am grateful both to our chief fire officer, chris lowther, and to the chair of tyne and wear fire authority, councillor barry curran, for taking time to meet mps in recent weeks to discuss the new integrated risk management plan, and for being so candid when answering our questions. i have no criticism of our fire and rescue service under our fire chief ; it has done its very best to provide a high level of service to our communities in the last eight years, despite the massive government cuts to its budget. nor have i any criticism of our hardworking councillors who serve on the fire authority and are managing their way through particularly tough times for local government. as a member of the fire brigades union parliamentary group, i am more than aware of all the problems that cuts to resources have caused, and i have nothing but praise for the commitment and dedication of each of our firefighters, to whom we owe a great debt for keeping us all safe, day in, day out. over the past few years, they have worked diligently throughout a succession of cuts to services and staffing, as well as having to suffer an erosion of their own terms and conditions. i am grateful to see that the policing and fire minister is here, and i hope that he will be open minded as i talk about funding cuts to our fire service.']"

there is also a wider concern.', ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr gapes. i thank my hon. friend the member for east lothian ( martin whitfield ) for securing this timely and important debate. there is no doubt that how we access banking services has changed in recent times. however, as with any change, there is a balance to be struck between evolving practice - in this case, the rise of online banking - and ensuring that the drive for change does not cause damaging disruption to the services local communities rely on. the recent round of bank closures by rbs, nat west and lloyds has got the balance wrong, as did the previous round of bank closures. the government ' s view is that bank closures are a commercial matter only and that they will not intervene in such issues. as someone who used to run a small business - i refer members to my entry in the register of members ' financial interests - i can say from experience that local branches are not just private companies but essential utilities to the communities in which they are based. an easily available, well - run local bank branch has all the productivity benefits of good roads and a reliable internet connection. the government cannot absolve themselves of responsibility by claiming that such closures are simply a commercial matter. research by the federation of small businesses shows that branch closures are damaging to small businesses, with one study finding that lending to small businesses in a given postcode area fell by almost two thirds following a bank branch closure. lending for small businesses grows on average from one quarter to the next by 2. 13 %. however, after a closure, growth falls to 0. 79 % - a reduction of 63 %. in the last round of closures it was announced that six bank branches were closing in a matter of months. both blantyre and cambuslang no longer have any bank branches.""]"

it is a fallacy to believe that people who profess to be anti - racist cannot be anti - semitic, and that anti - semitism is confined to the right wing of politics. the notion of conspiratorial, powerful jews - or zionists - controlling international capital and manipulating the media for their own ends is to be found on the left as well. it is all too evident in the labour party ' s current problem with anti - semitism. the small british jewish community - less than 0. 5 % of the population - is increasingly disturbed by the growth and normalisation of anti - semitism."", ""i will not give way to the hon. lady because i have given way twice already and i do not want to take up too much time. i am glad that we will have our own holocaust museum alongside the palace of westminster, and i look forward to that being developed so that we can bring young people here to see the importance of that element of society. there are also actions that we can all take. i was proud to sponsor early - day motion 743 for holocaust memorial day, and i believe that 55 right hon. and hon. members have signed it so far. the book of commitment will be available for members to sign each day next week between 2pm and 4pm close to the members ' cloakroom, and i commend that to all members. we also have the challenge of combating anti - semitism on university campuses. one current challenge is that many jewish children go to jewish schools and are not exposed to anti - semitism until they get to university. in my view, we are not preparing our young people sufficiently for what they may face, and i am delighted that the government are taking action to combat anti - semitism on university campuses by sponsoring visits for sabbatical officers to go to auschwitz - birkenau and to see at first hand what can happen if matters get out of hand. as we have said, the holocaust started with words and other forms of anti - semitism, and expanded to what we have seen in the death camps. we must commend all those who speak out against anti - semitism, from whichever political party. i was proud recently to share a platform with hon. friends on the opposition benches at my local synagogue, stanmore synagogue, for a question and answer session, during which i commended them for their bravery in standing up and calling out anti - semitism in their own party.""]"

i expect the minister will say, a€œwe have introduced new routes to expand the number of nursing staff. a€ there are nursing degree apprenticeships that few people are taking up, because employers do not have enough cash to release people to study. nursing associates, who were introduced in a supporting role to the registered nurse, should never be a substitute for registered nurses. these efforts have been small and unpredictable. most importantly, they have not addressed the heart of what grows the number of nurses safely and at scale : higher education. this is workforce panicking, not workforce planning. i expect the minister will say, a€œthis government have grown the number of nurses working in hospitals, a€ which is factually true, but distorts the truth that the overall number of nurses has only grown by less than 1 % since 2010. while there are 7 % more nurses in acute settings, there are 6, 500 fewer nurses in the community, 43 % fewer district nurses, a quarter fewer school nurses, nearly 5, 000 fewer mental health nurses and 40 % fewer learning disability nurses.', ""last month my mum celebrated her 95th birthday. like many irish nurses of her age, 75 years ago she travelled to london from ireland to start her career in the very first generation of nhs nurses by qualifying as a state enrolled nurse at warlingham park psychiatric hospital. growing up, i saw at first hand just how vital a dedicated, passionate and happy nurse was for the welfare of the patients. that is why i am incensed when i see the treatment of trainee nurses today. let us be clear. nursing students are exceptional. their courses are complex, their training is tough, and they spend significant amounts of time on clinical placement, working all hours of the day and night. they deserve a tuition and living cost funding model that recognises their extraordinary efforts and the importance of those efforts. england is now the only country in the uk without some form of bursary for the nursing degree. that has crumbled the number of nursing applications and fostered an environment that is utterly unfair to nursing students and completely unsafe for patients. the government promised that reforms would provide up to 10, 000 additional nursing and health professional training places but, since the loss of the bursary, nursing applications in england are down by a third and falling fast. in fact, the 2018 figure was the lowest since nursing courses were first included in the ucas system. nursing must be made an attractive profession for all groups, and restoring the bursary is a fundamental step to achieving that. now is not the time to experiment with funding models for nursing students. one in three nurses is due to retire within the decade. ensuring the long - term recruitment of new nurses must be a government priority. that, of course, is before we take account of the brexit impact : 75 % of nhs trusts have done nothing to prepare for the uk ' s departure from the eu.""]"

and, therefore, my department - for the hearing that occurred on 8 november last year, it is the case that there may well have been information that should have been included in the dossier and that was not provided, but it is worth pointing out that it is the responsibility of the parole board to satisfy itself that an offender is no longer a risk to the public. the judgment of sir brian leveson was that the parole board failed to probe that evidence sufficiently, as it should have done. i reiterate that the national probation service opposed the release of john worboys. i made no secret of the fact that i was considering whether to take a judicial review, and i set out in my earlier remarks the reasons why i did not bring that forward. the reality was that the victims were in a better position than me to bring a successful case. it is important that we ensure that when the parole board reaches a conclusion that meets certain criteria, there is an ability for it to look again and examine whether the relevant panel has performed its duties as it should have done.', ""i thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement on today ' s high court decision. today ' s unprecedented ruling, made possible by the human rights act, clearly highlights the deep flaws in the initial parole board decision. that initial decision clearly caused anguish for the victims -

out approach has facilitated a cultural change that has generated higher donor rates. that is why i am here today supporting my hon. friend ' s bill, which will address this bleak statistic and bring the discussion of organ donation back to the dinner tables of families across the uk. i also express my sincere thanks to the daily mirror for its campaign in support of the bill, which has shown the public the gift of life that is given by those who donate organs. one organ donor can transform as many as nine people ' s lives. as has been mentioned, the uk has one of the lowest family consent rates in europe. in wales, the welsh government bravely introduced deemed consent."", 'that is correct. as someone said earlier, we do not like talking about this stuff, although we should be talking about it more. if the bill provides us with such an opportunity, that is another reason why it needs to be welcomed. although three people a day die from a lack of suitable organs, the situation is worse among people from the bame community who are more likely to suffer from illnesses that require an organ transplant. the national bame transplant alliance has highlighted that issue, and said in its submission that consent to organ donation must be increased among ethnic minority communities, because transplants are more likely to be successful when the donated organ is a closer match to the recipient. sadly, however, within that community there is a lack of organs available for donation. that has to do with many issues, including a lack of willingness -

talk a little about the current inadequacy of the regulator and the section 166 procedure ; state why an independent mechanism of redress for business is clearly required ; and say why this is in the best interests not just of customers and the country, but of the banks themselves. this debate shows that the issues around the relationship between banks and their business customers are not fading, diminishing or going away. rather, in recent weeks we have continued to hear yet more appalling revelations about the way in which rbs ' s global restructuring group treated its customers and stories of how that had spread to other financial institutions too. following the efforts of my hon. friend the member for norwich south ( clive lewis ), we can now read the full section 166 report on the conduct of the grg unit. the extent of the inexcusable behaviour revealed in that report is truly shocking. the purchase of the assets of distressed businesses, in some cases by rbs staff themselves, illustrates just how deeply the conflicts ran within grg. clearly, certain bank employees felt that they could act with total impunity towards their customers, and that cannot be acceptable. we are all aware that the complaints process is ongoing between rbs and its former business customers who were the victims of grg. however, i echo the call made by my hon.""]"

in my view and, i think, all our views, it is even more important to the united kingdom because of the connectivity for the east of england. research from the brilliant essex chamber of commerce, a great champion of strategic infrastructure improvements across essex that has campaigned and worked with the business community, has shown that 56 % of essex businesses that responded to its survey regularly use the a120. only the a12 at 82 % and the m25 at 72 % were used more than the a120. however, the government know, and have heard not just from me but from successive members of parliament from the east of england over the last decade and more, that the a120 is not fit for purpose. it needs investment to unlock future economic growth and jobs. the a120 is also a dangerous road.', 'my hon. friend is absolutely right. delivering route d will provide a£1. 1 billion in gva through new jobs, businesses and housing. it is important that, when looking at the work that we do on transport across our region - on rail, for example - we put forward a coherent business case to the government for that very purpose. we are an attractive part of the country and we have different sectors that are expanding and growing. to be up front about this, when we think about our trading options and the economic benefit to the eastern region post brexit, investing in our roads will enormously benefit suffolk, norfolk and essex. that brings me to asking the minister to look into not only the a120 but the widening scheme for the a12, which is linked to the a120 - these roads cannot be seen in isolation. a failure of successive governments in the past has been to look at transport and roads as a singular and not a plural, in terms of having an integrated transport strategy. the government have already committed to widening parts of the a12 in a three - lane carriageway scheme. most of the first section to be upgraded - the stretch between the junction 19 boreham interchange at chelmsford and junction 25 at marks tey - runs through the witham constituency and is parallel to the great eastern main line. that widening scheme was subject to a consultation by highways england last year and we are expecting an announcement of the route and the sections to be re - routed. however, colchester borough council has unfortunately put a spanner in the works at the last minute, as part of its local plan process. i am mindful that i, other colleagues, highways england and local councils put forward proposals for the a12 widening scheme - announced back in 2014 - that would not be compromised by any work taking place with the local plans.']"

it is a question of how to make it safe and as enjoyable as possible. the rules are out - of - date and we need our government to act. it is clear from the turnout how many mps this campaign has reached. i was pleased to host an event on this important issue for the football supporters federation, safety experts and parliamentary colleagues before today ' s debate. safe standing is an issue whose time has come, a fact borne out by the simple numbers. it is borne out by its successful use outside the top two flights week in, week out. it is borne out by the 94 % of fans surveyed by the efl, who made it clear that they wanted a choice in the type of match day experience they had. it is also borne out by the more than 100, 000 football fans and supporters who signed the petition to secure today ' s debate. fans want safe standing even if they do not want it for themselves, and it is increasingly clear that clubs want safe standing, too. i was delighted that earlier this month my hon. friend the member for tooting ( dr allin - khan ) announced that the labour party backs safe standing. i salute her leadership on the issue."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr robertson. i want to thank the chair of the pompey supporters trust, simon colebrook, for talking with me about the issue, as well as our excellent shadow minister, my hon. friend the member for tooting ( dr allin - khan ), who has led our party in backing safe standing across the football league. i thank, also, the owner of portsmouth football club, who has written to me about this important issue today. in a debate about safe standing in championship and premier league games, pompey fans will be painfully aware that, despite a prolific history of european and top division football, not to mention multiple fa cup wins, our club are currently enjoying a short break from the pressures of the premier league. nevertheless, our time in this country ' s top two divisions means that, under current legislation, we are required permanently to remain all - seater. our club is therefore a prime example of the injustice of the government ' s stance on safe standing, because in reality the issue is not whether to bring safe standing into football grounds ; it is already there. when portsmouth fans travel to the grounds of bristol rovers, peterborough united, wycombe wanderers and countless other sides in the football league, they see stadiums where fully licensed standing sections are operated. yet back at fratton park they have no choice : standing sections are not allowed. that is all because we previously spent more than three seasons in the top two tiers. i must admit that i am puzzled about why the government think standing becomes safer as the quality of football gets worse. if that is true, southampton fans should not be made to sit. why should divisional status - and historical divisional status, at that - have implications for whether clubs can have standing sections at their grounds?"", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr robertson. i shall try to make some comments while ignoring the taunting of the portsmouth fan on the opposition benches to my right - although it is difficult to ignore. if we want to see who is successful in football, we need only note that southampton has survived in the premier league again this year, while pompey languishes somewhere closer to the sunday leagues. all - seater stadiums have been required by law since 1994. there were good reasons for introducing them, but i think that now is the time to consider whether we can have safe standing as well as seating. safe standing has been trialled and is now accepted as being safe. in 2011 the scottish premier league relaxed its requirement for all - seater stadiums and celtic, as has been mentioned, now has a safe standing space for 3, 000 supporters. next season, league one team shrewsbury town will join celtic and have its own safe standing area. the stunning st mary ' s stadium in southampton has a capacity of more than 32, 000. frequently 32, 000 fans attend to watch - unlike at portsmouth, not far down the road. the saints moved from the iconic dell ground in 2000. we used to stand on the terraces until the move to the new stadium. many football fans want to continue to stand, and southampton fans are no exception. fans in the northam stand all too often still stand, although by law they should not. that presents the club with a difficult decision about how to police the situation ; thus far it has not managed to do it. however, the situation proves that safe standing, even in an environment where there is standing between seats, has been safe for some 18 years at southampton football club.""]"

sex couples to obtain legal recognition of their relationships and access to the same legal rights as opposite - sex couples. in the first 10 years, 64, 000 people took up civil partnerships, according to the office for national statistics figures. the marriage ( same sex couples ) act 2013 meant that same - sex couples can marry under english and welsh law, and from the end of 2014, civil partners were granted the right to convert their civil partnerships into marriages. following a consultation in 2012, no changes were made to civil partnerships under the 2013 act. the government argued at the time that civil partnerships were created to allow same - sex couples equal access to the rights, responsibilities and protections for those who are married. in 2014, another consultation was launched to gather views and evidence on the future of civil partnerships. almost 11, 500 people responded, with a huge range of views. since that, there has been a legal case, which sits behind this bill. in 2016 a heterosexual couple presented a case to the high court arguing that they faced discrimination under present law. the case had much wider implications, and the judge granted the couple permission to take it to the court of appeal. the hearing took place in november 2016 and the judgment was delivered in february 2017. all three judges said that the claimants ' human rights were affected, but concluded by a majority that it was proportionate for the government to take time to decide the future of civil partnerships."", ""i congratulate the hon. member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ) on introducing such an important bill. i am proud that the landmark policy of civil partnerships was introduced by labour. we took a stand long before it was considered fashionable or acceptable. we took a stand to allow lesbian, gay and bisexual people to have their relationships recognised by law and to have benefits equal to those for married couples. that proud moment built on labour ' s history of fighting for the equal rights of lgbtq + people, and the civil partnership act 2004 paved the way for same sex marriage. following the passing of same sex - marriage legislation, it is a complete anomaly and unjustice that civil partnerships are not available to all, an anomaly that the government could have easily rectified and would have received support from both sides of the house to do so. although i was not a member at the time, it is clear that the only reason labour did not push further to extend civil partnerships during the passage of the marriage ( same sex couples ) act 2013 was for fear of losing it altogether. we were met with much hostility when we introduced civil partnerships, but we were on a mission to ensure some level of equality as quickly as possible, and we achieved just that. times have now moved on, but it appears that some attitudes have not. allowing some couples to choose whether to marry or to enter a civil partnership while others cannot is no equality at all. that anomaly is not in the spirit of either the civil partnership act or the marriage ( same sex couples ) act, which are based firmly in parity and not in the semantics that are often used to hide bigotry and prejudice. labour members believe that all people should be equal before the law."", ""i echo the support that has been expressed for the bill, which will ensure the registration of stillbirths before 24 weeks and give coroners the power to investigate stillbirths. i will concentrate on the clauses that address civil partnerships. i stress that i understand the case that hon. members have made today, and i applaud the passion of my hon. friend the member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ) for this topic. although i welcome a report and a review to find more evidence, i think that rolling out civil partnerships to everyone is not the right approach, as i am confident such a review would highlight. it is time to refresh our minds as to why civil partnerships were invented. they were invented because same - sex marriage was not legal. civil partnerships were not intended to be a permanent alternative to marriage. they were created to allow same - sex couples access to rights, responsibilities and protections equivalent to those afforded to married couples. that is no longer the case. i appreciate and empathise with the argument that the current situation is unequal because opposite - sex civil partnerships are not available, but the answer is not necessarily to expand civil partnerships. in fact, i would rather see civil partnerships cease altogether. today everyone in the uk can get married. we finally have equality, which is what people have campaigned for and fought for. expanding civil partnerships to all would serve to add an extra tier, which would confuse and complicate commitment, rather than encouraging it. let us also be clear that there is no legal difference between marriage and civil partnership. the differences are in the names, in the ceremonies and the fact that women are, of course, named on their children ' s civil partnership certificates, but we can address that separately - i passionately believe in naming women on their children ' s marriage certificates.""]"

we take them away from their environment and put them somewhere separate, where they generally respond much better. if people have committed crimes, they should have that impingement placed on them. the use of that technology should be denied them. i think that the purpose of the bill - i did not serve on the public bill committee, so i stand to be corrected on this - is to strengthen safety and security in prisons, through the authorisation of interference of public communications. in 2016 the government published plans for reforming the prison system, including the measures in the bill. the a€œprison safety and reforma€ white paper set out the government ' s plans to deliver a mix of operational changes and to underpin the legal changes required. our prisons face significant security challenges. in 2016, approximately 13, 000 mobile phones and 7, 000 sim cards were found in prisons - an incredible number. that was an increase of 7, 000 mobile phones from 2013."", 'the hon. lady is quite right, and i will go on to explain how mobile phones are used to continue crime in our prison service. to reiterate, last year 23, 656 mobile phones were found in our prisons, which is nearly 65 a day. in my constituency, 184 mobile phones and 80 sim cards were found at hmp lewes last year, and having visited the prison regularly and met prison officers and the governor, i have heard at first hand the implications of that. as the hon. lady pointed out, illegal mobile phones present a serious risk to the security of our prisons, as well as to public safety. mobile phones in prisons are used for a range of criminal purposes, including commissioning serious violence, harassing victims, and continuing involvement in extremist activity and organised crime. access to mobile phones is strongly associated with drug supplies and violence in our prisons, so it is a serious problem. it might be argued that the prison service should be better at stopping mobiles entering our prisons in the first place, but as the previous justice secretary made clear in a speech to reform in december last year, technological advances have been harnessed by some manufacturers with the clear intention of circumventing prison security measures. technological advances have made it possible to manufacture phones so small, and containing so little metal, that they can be concealed internally and are difficult to detect with existing screening machines. phones have been marketed as a€œbeat the bossa€, which refers to the body orifice security scanner that is in use in our prison receptions. however, just as technology can be harnessed for illicit ends, we can also enlist its support to improve the effectiveness of our response to the problem. public communications providers such as mobile phone operators have been at the forefront of rapid technological developments in mobile communications.', ""this welcome bill goes some way to addressing the issues surrounding mobile phones in prison, and as my hon. friend the member for west ham ( lyn brown ) said, evidence has shown time and again that mobile phones have been smuggled into prison for use by inmates, often to enable them to engage in further illegal activity. they are used illicitly to order drugs, harass victims, and organise crime, both inside and outside the prison. the use of phones for such activities is completely unacceptable, but figures indicate that the number of phones conveyed into prisons for use by inmates is increasing. the hon. member for lewes ( maria caulfield ) gave some figures, and i shall present some others that show a similar trend. in 2013, there were around 7, 500 reported incidences of mobile phones and sim cards being found in prison, but by 2015 that figure had increased to nearly 17, 000. mobile phone use in prisons is a problem that needs tackling, and the bill is a welcome step forward. i might question whether back benchers should be driving forward legislation to tackle illegal prison activity, rather than the government, but nevertheless the ability to interfere with wireless telegraphy and to disrupt mobile phone use in a designated, specified area could have a significant impact in reducing the use of mobile phones and, subsequently, any further illegal activity through their use. although the bill goes some way to addressing organised violence and drugs in prisons, it cannot be seen as a panacea to end the problems in our prisons. violence, drugs, and further crime are not helped by the government ' s treatment of our prisons system, which has produced an environment that allows them to flourish. the government ' s decision to slash prison budgets, axe prison officers and neglect our prisons has led to overcrowding and violence.""]"

building of the andsf.', ""with permission, mr speaker, i will make a statement on afghanistan. the united kingdom will never forget the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks and the thousands of innocent women, men and children killed in the atrocity. that barbaric violence prompted the uk, alongside our nato allies, to enter afghanistan to ensure that terrorists could not use it as a base from which to attack our citizens at home or abroad. before i continue, i want to pay tribute to the efforts of the tens of thousands of brave british men and women who have served in afghanistan for the past 16 years. we will never forget what they did, particularly those 456 brave men and women who paid the ultimate price and those who suffered life - changing injuries in the line of duty. their service and sacrifice has not been in vain. as i saw when i visited back in march, not only do millions of ordinary afghans now have access to clean water, vital medicine and education, which would not have seemed possible less than 20 years ago, not only have they enabled the afghan people to take charge of their own security, and not only is the capability of the afghan national defence and security forces growing, but elections are giving a voice to the people of afghanistan, who are increasingly calling for peace, which would have been unthinkable a short time ago. our commitment to afghanistan remains an enduring one. although uk combat operations ended in 2014, our troops are playing a key role in nato ' s resolute support mission by leading the kabul security force. they are performing a vital role in training, advising and assisting the afghan national army and air force and developing the nationwide security structures that will strengthen afghanistan ' s democracy. they have a quick reaction force that works alongside the afghan army to provide urgent help in kabul if and when required."", 'the hon. lady raises a very serious issue. the terrorist attack that she refers to was indeed appalling. as she said, too many victims lost their lives as a result of that attack that took place in afghanistan. it is important that we ensure that we are providing support, as we do through our contribution in afghanistan. that is a contribution to security in the kabul area specifically from our forces, but it is also about working with others to ensure that the afghan security forces are able to provide security and safety for all communities living in afghanistan. tremendous achievements have been made in afghanistan today, compared with the situation before these efforts, but sadly, as the hon. lady highlights, too many terrorist attacks are still taking place in afghanistan. we will continue to work with our allies and the afghan government to prevent these in future and to ensure that people can go about their daily lives in safety and security and with confidence.']"

a€it is absolutely right that every workplace - this place included - should recognise that having a child is a life - changing event for new mothers and new fathers, and should try to be as family - friendly as possible. i share the concern of the hon. member for harrow east ( bob blackman ) that we are not being ambitious enough. we should not be timid. if we agree with the principle of proxy voting, which i think everybody here does, we should extend it to people in other challenging circumstances, such as members who are suffering from illness, members who have a spouse or close family member who is living with an illness, or members who are dealing with the death of a child or partner. people have talked about the special bond between parents and their new baby and said that that is why this category should be different, but while it is very important for parents to spend time with their new baby, it is also important for members of this house to be able to spend time with a loved one who is dying. if we accept the principle of proxy voting, we should be more generous in our application of it. when proxy voting is brought in, it will be in the form of a pilot, and i would like that pilot to be more inclusive. the hon. member for harrow east said that some mps may not wish their constituents to know if they are very ill.', 'i thank my hon. friend for making that clear. we are office holders, not employees. the responsibility is different but, on this issue, it would be right to give a parent who has lost their child - that has never happened to me, and i cannot even begin to imagine how challenging it must be - the same right to choose a proxy, should they wish to. others may not wish to. it is all about choice. one other group of parents that is very challenged - not just in this place but in this country - is the mothers and fathers of very premature babies. they often spend many months in the neonatal unit and then find that by the time they get their baby home, they have run out of parental leave. the charity bliss does amazing work to help those with very premature babies, and that small number of families should get extra support from society. the question has been raised of who else should be able to have a proxy vote and whether this is about more than just parental leave - which, by the way, i agree means fathers, mothers and adoptive parents as well. for example, should proxy voting cover the circumstances that i remember with my third child? i went back to work very early, having just started my own business, and found myself suddenly with a very sick three - month - old child. i had stopped my parental leave and needed to go back into hospital. should a parent be able to restart their leave? those are challenging issues that one would need to look at as the system evolves, which is why i support the idea of introducing proxy voting with a trial. we can then see how it evolves. my suggestion is that it should just be for parental leave - fathers and mothers of babies, including adopted babies - and not widened out to other issues at this stage, even though people need time off.']"

the appointment of the first victims ' commissioner to champion the interests of victims and witnesses in 2010 ; and the publication of a€œgetting it right for victims and witnessesa€ in 2012, which set out the government ' s approach to ensuring that victims and witnesses get the support they need. the victims strategy consolidates and builds on that progress but recognises that more still needs to be done. i thank and pay tribute to all the victims, victims ' groups and experts who have willingly shared their experiences and sat on the victims panel, and to my predecessor, my hon. friend the member for bracknell ( dr lee ), who initiated this work."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mrs main. it has been a pleasure to hear all the contributions this afternoon, especially that of my hon. friend the member for telford ( lucy allan ). i hope i can go some way to answer all the questions, including the battery of questions that the shadow minister just posed. if i do not answer the questions appropriately, hon. members will get correspondence following the debate. i thank the hon. member for leeds north west ( alex sobel ) for securing this debate on the rights of victims of crime. it is particularly timely given the recent focus on such matters in a number of high - profile cases. i know through my own personal experience of meeting victims of crime, speaking with support organisations and meeting many of the hon. members present, exactly how important such rights are in the lives of victims. i am therefore grateful for the opportunity to discuss them with you today. victims ' rights are now a fundamental part of our justice system, and ensuring that victims receive the rights they are entitled to is a priority for this government. that is essential if we are to enable victims to cope with and recover from crime. we must also continue to drive improvement in the broader experience of victims, which involves ensuring that criminal justice agencies provide victims with a service appropriate to their needs and respectful of them as individuals. that also requires focus on the wider performance of agencies. victims want cases to be well managed and dealt with swiftly. beyond the criminal justice agencies, it is important that victim support services are in a position to offer victims the sorts of support they may need to aid their long - term recovery. turning to the current framework of victims ' rights, we look first to the statutory victims code, which does two fundamentally important things. first, it sets out for victims exactly what they are entitled to receive from the criminal justice system.""]"

long may it remain so. another point worthy of note is that the new management of channel 4 have embraced the process. a year ago, when i was re - elected to the house of commons and had my first contacts with channel 4, there were doubts about whether it could possibly come out of london and whether the talent would be available, and we heard about moving schools and all the same sorts of excuses that were made in the debate about the bbc 10 or 15 years ago. i am very pleased. i congratulate ministers and shadow ministers on keeping up the pressure ; i think channel 4 management are now behind the process. channel 4 is a great british institution. there are few that are similar in other nations in europe, except perhaps zdf and ard in germany. to have two great public service broadcasters, and channel 4 with its particular remit, is something that makes me proud to be british.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the relocation of channel 4. it is a pleasure to see you in the chair, sir graham. channel 4 is undoubtedly one of our finest, most precious broadcasting assets, as evidenced by the fact that there has been intense interest from many cities and regions across the united kingdom in hosting its new national headquarters and new creative hubs, representing 300 new channel 4 jobs, which will not only expand its footprint across the united kingdom but deepen its relationship with viewers. rightly, channel 4 has set a high bar for bidding cities and regions, requiring robust local infrastructure and transport and, in particular, frequent, fast and reliable connectivity. for the national headquarters, it is looking for a home with a population of at least 200, 000, travel time to the city of london within three hours and a high level of physical and digital connectivity. as a glasgow member of parliament, i am sure right hon. and hon. members will understand that i am immensely pleased to see that my home city is putting in a bold, strong and ambitious bid to be the new home of channel 4. i am particularly pleased that the chair of that bid is the famous glaswegian journalist and broadcaster stuart cosgrove. beyond channel 4 ' s physical requirements, it is ultimately looking for somewhere it can feel at home. it is looking for a diverse city that has a thriving arts and production scene ; a city that is not afraid to go against the grain ; and a city that has a confident sense of itself but is always looking to stretch itself and take on new challenges. setting aside the physical criteria, i wish to set out the case for scotland ' s largest city. the truth is that if channel 4 was a city, it would be the city of glasgow."", 'it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir graham. i congratulate the hon. member for glasgow south ( stewart malcolm mcdonald ) on securing this backbench debate. when launching a€œ4 all the uka€, the chief executive of channel 4, alex mahon, said : a€œas a public service broadcaster with diversity in its dna, channel 4 has a unique ability to reflect our society. this is a significant and exciting moment of change for channel 4 as we evolve to ensure we are best suited to serve all of the uk. with this new strategy we will go even further to make sure that people right across the uk are represented on screen and in the make up of our own organisation - and it will also build on what we already do to support creative businesses, jobs and economies in the nations and regions. a€today we have an opportunity to debate what that means and how channel 4 can achieve that objective in practice with three new creative hubs and a new national headquarters outside london. as we have already heard, the criteria that channel 4 has set for its new national headquarters is that the new location should have a working population of at least 200, 000, travel time to london of up to three hours, and a high level of physical and digital connectivity and infrastructure. in addition, channel 4 has listed five considerations that it has identified to support the evaluation of submissions that will be undertaken by channel 4 and its advisers. the considerations are economic, demographic, diversity and environmental factors ; the existing availability of talent and a future pipeline, including educational links ; local connectivity and broader infrastructure ; ease and speed of travel for channel 4 employees and partners between the different creative hubs ; and effectiveness and efficiency of available office space. i want to argue today that the west midlands should be the choice for channel 4 to meet those criteria.']"

the latest figures show that services for deaf children are reducing across england. that means that their futures are being a€œstolena€, as the national deaf children ' s society puts it, because without the support, intervention and specialist skills that they need, they will not be able to make the best educational and social progress compared with other children who are not deaf or hearing impaired. that cannot be right. there are more than 50, 000 deaf children and young people in the uk. as we have heard, more than 90 % of them are born to hearing parents who have no prior experience of deafness. some 80 % of those children attend mainstream schools, where they may be the only deaf child in their school. figures from the national deaf children ' s society show a stark difference in educational achievement as it is. in the early years foundation stage, 34 % of pre - school deaf children were reported as having a good level of development compared with 76 % of other children. at key stage 2, less than half of deaf children achieved the expected standard for reading, compared with 80 % of other children. at key stage 4, deaf children achieve, on average, a whole grade less in each gcse subject than other children. in recent years this attainment gap has widened."", ""i thank my hon. friend for that intervention. i agree with that statement, and i hope to explain why. the petitioners want bsl to be part of the national curriculum, giving better life chances to young people who are deaf. they believe that if bsl becomes part of the national curriculum, that will even up the chances of deaf young people being able to play a full part in school and attain the best results they can. let us look at the case. research by the national deaf children ' s society into the attainment of deaf children in 2017 shows that deaf children continue to underachieve throughout their education compared with other children. although the department for education claimed recently that attainment for deaf children is at an all - time high, the latest figures show that the attainment gap between deaf children and children with no identified special needs is widening, with the gap at gcse level being particularly worrying. in 2016, 41. 3 % of deaf children achieved the expected benchmark of five gcses at a * to c grade, compared with 69. 3 % of children with no identified special needs. that is a difference of more than 20 %, which is just not acceptable in this day and age. all that is in the context of a reduction of 14 % in the number of qualified teachers of the deaf since 2011, and a 2 % reduction in just one year - 2016 - 17. we know that we have to do more to help deaf pupils to achieve their full potential and that we need to reverse the reduction in the number of teachers of the deaf. we can do that partly by ensuring that young deaf pupils are able to have effective communication. for many, that will be through bsl. bsl has been a recognised language since 2003, but unlike other languages it is not recognised as a gcse that can be taught in schools."", ""i agree strongly with my hon. friend ' s point. it is really important that deaf children are able to take part fully in the life of the school. in 2016 - 17, signature carried out a survey of more than 2, 000 young people, of whom 700 were deaf and 1, 400 were hearing, on behalf of the national deaf children ' s society youth advisory board, which is made up of young people from across the uk, such as erin, who believe strongly that there should be more opportunities for young people - deaf or hearing - to learn bsl, which is an officially recognised language in the uk. the survey showed that 91 % of young people want to learn sign language, 92 % think schools should offer a bsl gcse, and 97 % think bsl should be taught in schools. their reasons include inclusivity, as doing those things would ensure that deaf people are fully integrated into society and not disadvantaged because others cannot communicate with them effectively ; the importance of communication in general ; and equality - they likened learning bsl to learning french or spanish and said that bsl was at least equally important. they thought that being able to use bsl would improve employment prospects, both directly and indirectly, but many did not know of anywhere they could learn it at no or little cost. i have already mentioned the shortage of qualified teachers of the deaf, but there is a wider shortage. in 2017, the department for work and pensions highlighted that shortages in sign language interpreters have resulted in higher costs for government programmes such as access to work, and have made it harder for deaf people to enter the workplace. a gcse could lead to more people considering interpreting for deaf people as a career. i do not want to make this petition downbeat.""]"

wing plots have also been foiled since the westminster attack. but as we know all too well, there were five terrorist attacks last year. thirty - six people were murdered, and many more are still grieving or coming to terms with life - changing injuries as a result of the terrorist atrocities in london and manchester. we owe it to the victims and survivors to do our very best to prevent such attacks from happening again. of course, as home secretary, i do not want to offer false hope. no home secretary can guarantee that there will not be another terrorist attack on their watch. it is impossible for me to promise that there will not be more grieving parents, partners and children because of some senseless act of terrorist violence in the future. but what i can do as home secretary is to take a long, hard, forensic look at the powers available to the police, security services, prosecutors and judiciary, and to make sure that they have what they need, including powers to tackle the evolving threat to the uk from terrorism and from hostile state activity and powers to keep the public safe and protect our national security.', 'i pay tribute to the many people who work in counter - terrorism, whose efforts make the united kingdom a relatively safe place in which to live. the enormity of what they do for us can often go overlooked, because their success is measured by what does not happen rather than by what does. without their hard work, so many days that have passed relatively peacefully and uneventfully would have turned out very differently for each of us. therefore, for their tireless efforts against the terrorist threat, they deserve the thanks of the whole house and, indeed, the whole country. i am glad to support a uk government who take the terrorist threat to our country seriously, and who fund counter - terrorism efforts accordingly. i pay particular tribute to the decision in january to increase the counter - terrorism policing budget by a£50 million to a£757 million. compare this a£757 million that the conservatives are putting towards counter - terror policing now with the a£552 million that labour put towards it in its last year in office - even at a time when it was content to run a deficit of a£154 billion - and it is not hard to tell which party is truly committed to properly funding counter - terrorism. however, counter - terrorism is not just a matter for the police. our intelligence services - mi5, mi6 and gchq - play a vital role in countering terrorism and in helping build a safer britain and a safer world. the single intelligence account, which funds those crucial services, has also seen its budget increase. all in all, the uk government are working hard to meet their commitment to increase counter - terrorism spending by 30 % over the five years to 2020, reaching an ultimate total of a£5. 1 billion. this is how we address the threats to this country at a time when the nature of terrorism is changing dramatically.', 'i come to this debate wanting to be positive about attempts by the government to give our police and security forces the powers that they need in the fight against terrorism and to balance that with the equal priority of ensuring that we do not hit our civil liberties and therefore give the terrorists a victory. already we have heard how different aspects of this bill will be judged by those tests. no one who witnessed the horrors in london and manchester last year can be in any doubt that we need to redouble our efforts to protect the public. the evidence is clear, and the terrorist threat across the uk remains severe. with that threat morphing into a diverse range of threats, including people acting alone, and with the numbers involved increasing, if anything, the terrorist threat for our security forces and the police is probably the most difficult it has ever been. liberal democrats will not, at this early stage, seek to oppose this bill, but ministers and those watching this debate should not take that as agreement, in full or in part, to these proposed laws. we need to scrutinise the bill to make sure that we get the balance right. it is already clear from this debate that there are serious questions whether some of these proposed laws are necessary, whether they are properly based on sound evidence and whether there are sufficient safeguards to prevent their being abused against totally innocent citizens. the government may have a job in persuading this house and the other place that these measures should pass totally unamended in the form that we see them tonight. in considering yet another piece of terrorism legislation, the house should recall the opinion of the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, max hill, when he was appointed just over a year ago. he said that he thought that the uk had sufficient offences in the fight against terrorism and that we did not need any more.']"

it covers door - to - door transport, ranging from the relatively informal lift giving by volunteer car drivers to more organised schemes such as a dial - a - ride or dial - a - bus for people with disabilities and mobility difficulties. it involves community bus services and covers minibus travel for groups of people such as the elderly or others who struggle to get out and about on their own, where they are taken on shopping trips and such like."", 'that is a really important point ; i thank the hon. gentleman for that intervention. the problem is that, as a consequence of the regulations, people will be denied access to local amenities, leisure facilities and employment opportunities. my hon. friend the member for nottingham south indicated the cost - some a£400 million. people are rightly angry and frustrated about the implications of the changes. i am angry about the quality of the transport infrastructure in my constituency, and this will simply compound that. the proposed guidance from the government implies that community transport providers need to show that they are not blocking commercial operators that may wish to deliver a local service on a particular route - the section 19 and 22 recommendations that have been mentioned. however, community transport is plugging the gaps of a failing commercial network. the ongoing withdrawal of commercial bus services means that the community transport sector as a whole has gained growing importance in filling transport gaps, particularly in largely rural areas such as mine. many voluntary transport services are financially fragile, and rely on donations and the goodwill of volunteers to continue. the government must realise that community transport is about so much more than simply moving people from a to b. it brings people together, teaches people new skills, makes disabled and elderly people in rural areas less socially isolated, improves physical and mental health, and makes communities pull together to tackle many issues that they face on a daily basis. i share the reservations of community transport providers in my constituency that the department for transport, sitting in splendid isolation in offices in central london, may find it difficult to comprehend the service and support provided by community transport. i share the view of my hon. friend the member for nottingham south that the narrow and legalistic approach that the government are adopting to community transport is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.', ""i, like a number of colleagues, will focus on community transport. as a labour and co - operative mp, i am particularly keen to talk about the not - for - profit sector. the co - operative party believes that community transport and commercial bus routes should be designated community assets that are, as my hon. friend the member for harrow west ( gareth thomas ) said, subject to the same protections as community assets are afforded under the localism act 2011. tens of thousands of people rely on these services for some of the most socially necessary journeys. the government ' s announcement that they seek to change regulations on the community transport sector was a big surprise. as a result, many such services are now under threat, and there will be a reduction in this socially necessary public transport. community transport is a very broad term. it includes local road passenger transport services delivered by charities and other not - for - profit organisations, typically where there is no viable commercial market. the core of community transport organisations includes door - to - door transport, informal lift - giving by volunteer car drivers, dial - a - ride and dial - a - bus, particularly for people with disabilities and mobility difficulties, and groups such as the elderly and others who struggle to get out and about. this transport is required, for example, to take them on shopping trips. the community transport association estimates that tens of thousands of people, many of whom are the most vulnerable in our communities, access this form of transport. it has outlined why these journeys are such a lifeline for many. preston community transport, which is based in my constituency, is just one such community transport organisation. it claims that there are nowa€œsignificant problems as a result of the department for transport ' s proposed changes to permits and licences.""]"

what about the huge number of existing meters that will be removed and need to be disposed of as smart meters are installed? those meters are not owned by installers but by meter asset providers that finance and ultimately own the meters that are put in. it has been a long - standing arrangement in the industry that meters are not owned by the suppliers but merely read by the suppliers. that means that when a programme is pursued of removing old meters, whether dumb meters or previous generation smart meters, there is a problem in identifying whose meters they are. the difficulty that we are facing right now - it is not a problem for the future - is that we might see meter mountains arising in this country because the people who are removing the meters do not know who their owners are or who is going to take them away and recycle and dispose of them. i do not want to see, as a result of this roll - out programme, meter mountains, or alps, appearing across the country.']"

does the minister accept that this was a colossal waste of police resources? as a former police officer, i can tell him that that is the case. is he aware that, according to his department ' s own research, black people are eight times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched, and asian people are twice as likely?

this should concern the house greatly - is the growing risk of drug resistance. tb is the only major drug resistant infection that is transmitted through the air. it is already responsible for one in three deaths worldwide from all forms of drug resistance."", 'i am pleased to be able to speak in this important debate, and i am grateful to the right hon. member for arundel and south downs ( nick herbert ) and the hon. member for ealing, southall ( mr sharma ) for securing it. the fact that tb continues to kill more people every year than any other infectious disease is appalling. we have enjoyed a harmonious and well - informed debate, and i am grateful to the right hon. member for arundel and south downs for his tremendous summary and history of the issue. i have a bit more history for the house. first, though, i would like to give the scottish picture. tb levels in scotland are relatively stable and low. it accounts for between eight and nine cases per 100, 000 of the population and is a contributing factor in about 40 deaths a year - although any death is a death too many. archaeological records show signs of tuberculosis in the remains of ancient mummies, and on this very day 689 years ago, robert the bruce, king of scots, is alleged to have died of tuberculosis. tb has killed more people than any other disease in history. the modern scottish government are playing their part in tackling global challenges, including epidemics and health inequalities. since 2005, the scottish government have committed at least a£3 million a year towards funding international development work. this was initially focused on malawi to reflect 150 years of collaborative development between our two countries. in 2017, that was increased to a£10 million a year. tb is a major public health problem in malawi, and multi - drug - resistant tb is an emerging issue. as mentioned, there is also a significant link between tb and hiv, with more than half the cases in malawi being infected with both.']"

canada deal once the uk has left the eu, and formally announced the establishment of a working group to ensure that the transition was as seamless as possible. officials from our two countries have already begun to meet to discuss that transition. it is important that, as a first step, we prevent a a€œcliff edgea€ for british and canadian businesses. of course, while we remain in the eu we continue to support its ambitious trade agenda. free trade is not a zero -

canada trade deal. that is the position not only of prime minister trudeau but of the canadian opposition leader andrew scheer, who was here and met the secretary of state only a few months ago. so the hon. gentleman would rip up a deal that the canadian side in good faith wants to use as the basis of a trade deal. i am afraid the hon. gentleman ' s position is total nonsense and would be hugely damaging to those british producers who are already benefiting from the initial application of these provisions. i also want to say something about the current environment in canada based on what i find when i make my visits out there and also welcome canadians here. there is massive support for this agreement in canada, which leads into huge support for a seamless transition into a uk - canada trade deal, because canada recognises that, particularly in terms of public procurement, there are specific skills that this country has that are needed to make good on some of canada ' s infrastructure investment plans. in my earlier intervention i mentioned that there are a£20 billion -

our seventh - largest non - european export market. in turn, we are canada ' s third most important export market. our appetite for canadian goods means that canada runs a trade surplus with us of some $ 6. 8 billion according to 2017 figures. we are canada ' s most important european trading partner. the vast majority of canada ' s european - bound goods move through our ports. we are the second - biggest recipient of canadian investment. similarly, we are the second - biggest foreign direct investor into canada. more than an estimated 700 british firms have an established presence in canada and some 1, 100 uk firms are owned or controlled by canadian interests. in matters of trade, the uk and canada face similar issues. boeing ' s efforts to have punitive tariffs levied on bombardier c series aircraft threaten thousands of jobs both in canada and here, where the company ' s northern ireland plant engineers and manufactures wings for those aircraft. we both face the spurious and illegal tariffs imposed by president trump on our steel and aluminium exports under the false pretence of national security. do we want a trade deal with canada?""]"

working staff who have gone for years without a decent pay rise. while some hospitals offer free or discounted parking for specific kinds of treatment or for people in receipt of specific benefits, there are significant variations in fees across trusts in the same region. wexham park hospital in my constituency has some of the highest parking charges in the region : a£3. 30 after the first 15 minutes and an increase, in stages, to a£8 over five hours. that is the situation in my constituency, but that trust is only doing what all other trusts are no doubt doing and it is within government guidelines. i do not want older and vulnerable patients to be deterred from attending hospital. they should be able to get to their appointments in a comfortable, dignified, affordable manner and within a reasonable time. most nhs car parking charges have been abolished in scotland and wales, and i know that the government have issued guidance to nhs trusts on the implementation of car parking charges, including the provision of discounted or free parking. these guidelines are not based in legislation and appear to have had little effect. the labour government in 2010 left fully costed plans to phase out charges for in - patients and their visitors, and in 2015 a private member ' s bill on this subject gained cross - party support but was talked out. clearly, many across the country and the house want an end to hospital car parking charges. let us send a clear message today that there is another way forward and that this unfair stealth tax on the vulnerable must end."", ""i am so glad that the right hon. gentleman raised that issue, because the concession that i was talking about is available only to the patient, not to the low - paid person who may have driven the patient to hospital. the poorly person has to go and get the car parking concession. it is absolutely unfair. a freedom of information request by unison revealed that some hospitals charge nurses and health professionals who regularly visit hospitals up to a£100 a month. as other members have said, the cost of parking also has wider effects on the surrounding streets. i have been contacted by many constituents living around dewsbury and district hospital who complain that those who cannot afford car parking charges, or who think they might have to stay for several hours, park on residential streets, blocking people ' s drives and making it difficult for people to park outside their own homes. free hospital parking would end that. we know that trusts are struggling to balance the books after years of being underfunded by the government, but we must ensure that they are not forced to fill the funding gap by charging sick and poorly patients, their visitors and anxious relatives, and already hard - pressed nhs staff. car parking charges are a tax on serious illness. labour would scrap car parking charges at all hospitals. we would fund that by raising insurance tax on private healthcare to 20 %, to meet the a£162 million cost of providing free parking at all nhs hospitals in england. charities, trade unions, the british medical association, the society for acute medicine and the public are all calling out for the government to listen. in scotland and wales, car parking charges have been abolished in all but a handful of hospitals. we should show some humanity and do the same. i support the motion."", ""it is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for telford ( lucy allan ). we all know that our nhs is underfunded. the hospital trust in my constituency, the hull and east yorkshire hospitals nhs trust, received more than a£1. 5 million in car parking charges in 2016 - 17, according to data released under a freedom of information request, so it might seem unusual for me to be calling for the abolition of car parking charges. we know that they can provide an income for hospitals, but i agree with the hon. lady : much of the money does not go to the hospital, but often to the private operator of the car park. it is the government ' s responsibility to ensure that our nhs has the money it needs and not that of patients, staff or visitors. we should not expect vulnerable people to pay a sickness tax through car parking charges. i also agree with my hon. friend the member for great grimsby ( melanie onn ) about the impact on residents living in the local area. in walker street opposite my hospital, resident permits have had to be introduced to try to stop other people parking on those streets. in effect, the residents who live there have to pay to park their cars, because staff cannot afford to use the car park and park their cars on those streets. the whole system is complete nonsense. i am incredibly proud that our labour manifesto pledged to scrap car parking charges. our suggestion was that any loss in income could come from a hike in the tax on private healthcare insurance. that would meet the a£162 million cost of free parking at all nhs hospitals across england. the unfairness of the sickness tax, from having car parking charges, must be felt in context. let me tell the chamber about a dear friend of mine -

to establish a financial inclusion fund, and provide for amounts received in such penalties to be paid into that fund ; and for connected purposes. recently link, which set the funding formula for atm operators, consulted its members on proposals to reduce from 25p to 20p the interchange fee paid to atm operators by banks when cash is withdrawn. the first phase of the cut will take place on 1 july 2018. this proposed reduction in the funding formula has led to concerns that many atms will become financially unviable and therefore may be forced to close or charge a fee to remain in use. the bill seeks to remove the option for atms to become fee - charging by banning fees. i take this position, first and foremost, out of principle, as i do not believe that anyone should have to pay to access their own money. however, a ban on atm charges makes it a practical necessity that an appropriate funding formula for free - to - use atms be devised. in supporting this objective, the bill seeks to provide a legal requirement for access to cash withdrawals through atms or other means where there is a demand for it. such demand would be established through a full market review of the atm network by the payment systems regulator. there has been no recent review of the demand for access to cash, and as we transition towards a cashless society it is important that we fully and comprehensively establish where demand remains for cash in order to target resources effectively.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the effect of atm closures on towns, high streets and rural communities. it is a pleasure to see you in the chair, mr hollobone. i and other hon. members on both sides of the house have been raising the closure of atms and its impact on our towns, high streets and rural communities for some time. the issue is more pressing than ever. in november 2017, link, the atm membership body that sets the funding for free - to - use atms, began consulting on proposed cuts to the funding mechanism known as the interchange rate fee - a fee paid to the atm operator, by the bank or company that issues a consumer ' s bank card, when cash is withdrawn. prior to link ' s reductions, that fee was 25p. in its consultation, link proposed reducing the fee to 20p through four rounds of cuts beginning on 1 july this year and ending in january 2021, although the third cut was cancelled and the fourth has been put under review. from the beginning, link accepted that those changes would lead to atm closures. in its analysis and consultation documents, it stated that it expected a decline of between 1 % and 11 % in free - to - use atms, but that it was confident that there would be a reduction only in areas with a high concentration of free - to - use atms, such as cities. however, the number of closures has been far higher - approximately 250 per month - since link announced its consultation. operators such as note machine and cardtronics say they expect to lose thousands of machines each, and new installations have been put on hold.""]"

the rationale for excluding flour from fortification is unclear. there is clearly strong support for that among members of the medical profession.""]"

overall, the co2 emissions of a diesel car tend to be lower, diesel fuel contains more energy per litre than petrol and diesel engines are more efficient than petrol engines, especially in rural environments. modern euro 6 diesel cars are the cleanest in history : they capture 99 % of particulates and emit 84 % fewer nox emissions than in 2000. so, we know that new diesels do not compare to the older ones. we also know from data from the society of motor manufacturers and traders that average co2 emissions from cars sold in 2017 were higher than in 2016, reversing a near 20 - year decline. they blame that increase on the demonisation of diesel since 2015, which means that we cannot take for granted the progress made in reducing co2 emissions since 2000. we are heading in the wrong direction, as diesel sales have fallen by 37 % since last year. mike hawes, smmt chief executive, criticised the autumn budget, which increased taxes on sales of new diesels. he commented that people were concerned about these tax increases and werea€œholding off buying new diesel cars because of the confusion and that means older, dirtier diesels are staying on the roads. a€that is precisely the point made by the hon. member for solihull ( julian knight ). nick molden, chief executive of testing company emissions analytics, agreed that, rather than impose higher taxes on new cars, the oldest cars and dirtiest diesel cars should be targeted instead.', ""as has been mentioned, this sector has been one of britain ' s greatest manufacturing success stories, providing thousands of jobs and a major contribution to our country ' s economic growth. the story of my own constituency ' s past cannot be told without an understanding of the sector, dominated by ford ' s dagenham plant, which at its height employed some 40, 000 workers. today, dagenham ' s two engine plants produce 1 million diesel engines annually - 50 % of ford ' s global diesel requirement - and provide over 3, 000 jobs. some 89 % of those engines are exported. the total turnover stands at a£1. 75 billion. however, investment in britain ' s car industry has halved during the past two years. brexit concerns and the demonization of diesel appear to be the two biggest challenges. the crisis of confidence in diesel vehicles and diesel technology was triggered by volkswagen ' s emissions scandal, but the upshot has been damage to not just vw but the whole sector. i am not seeking to defend older diesel engines, which, in truth, are more polluting than their petrol counterparts. however, we must bring some nuance back into the debate. all diesel technology is being tarred with the same brush, despite the fact that state - of - the - art diesel technology is a vast improvement over its predecessors. as has been mentioned, those dirtier engines will, ironically, be kept on the road longer if consumers are misinformed about the difference between diesel technologies. it is clean - diesel technology that is being invested in in dagenham. ford invested a£490 million in developing clean, cutting - edge diesel technology in dagenham in 2014. this new generation of clean engines meets the euro 6 emissions standards and satisfies transport for london ' s ultra - low emission zone."", ""that shows the cross - party agreement on some of the points i am making today. the trouble is that in the uk, germany, france and spain - the markets where anti - diesel rhetoric is highest - diesel consumption is declining fastest. sales of diesel cars have slumped as regulators and politicians announce plans for bans, levies and additional taxes in many cities. in truth, we in dagenham fear that diesel has become a bit of a political football. in 2001, gordon brown introduced a new system of car tax aimed at protecting the environment - a sliding scale to make it cheaper for cars with lower co2 emissions. that helped stimulate a dash for diesel after its introduction in 2001 and its extension in subsequent years. there are now some 12 million diesel cars on british roads, while back in 2000 there were only 3 million. in recent years, diesel has accounted for around half of the new car market. in 2000, by comparison, only one in seven new cars was a diesel model, yet following a 2017 bbc report on the dangers of diesel, the environment secretary jumped into the debate to make political capital : a€œthe dash for diesel was pursued under a labour government... this is yet another example of a conservative government having to clean up labour ' s mess... we are taking action... ending the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040. a€political game playing should have no role, given the challenges facing the sector, as reflected in the comments made by colleagues across the house today. since the 2015 vw revelations, cities have taken the lead over national governments.""]"

for example, angus is a rural area that has to have a different approach to fly - tipping from that of a more urban area. larger rural areas such as angus naturally have more remote spaces where fly - tippers might choose to dump their rubbish."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr howarth. fly - tipping is a problem that affects communities the length and breadth of the country, including in the area i represent. that is why i welcome today ' s debate and congratulate the hon. member for tiverton and honiton ( neil parish ) on securing it. levels of fly - tipping are spiralling across coventry. the problem is particularly acute in the foleshill and stoke areas of my constituency. those areas are blighted by domestic and commercial fly - tippers targeting streets, shared communal areas and open green spaces, often leaving them strewn with all types of waste. alleyways are blocked with old mattresses, shopping trollies and even bathtubs. streets are scattered with litter and bags of rubbish, and our parks are blighted by abandoned sofas and old electrical goods. i have witnessed the impact of fly - tipping on my local communities in coventry. it is a scar on the local environment, and causes misery to law - abiding residents, affecting how they feel about the place they call home. moreover, fly - tipping is a financial burden on our local authority that diverts money away from crucial services such as adult social care. coventry city council takes the problem of fly - tipping seriously and is determined to tackle it head - on. it works hard to deter such criminal acts, to investigate and clean up incidents of fly - tipping when they occur, and to penalise those who engage in it. last year the council prosecuted 35 people for fly - tipping, and it is pursuing 15 cases through the judicial system this year. none the less, the council recognises that more needs to be done to tackle this growing problem, which is why it has earmarked an additional a£100, 000 this year to create a new mobile team to combat fly - tipping."", ""it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr howarth, and i congratulate my hon. friend the member for tiverton and honiton ( neil parish ) on securing the debate. we have heard wide - ranging contributions from other hon. members, recognising some of the work that has been done and some of the challenges still before us. i welcomed the opportunity to discuss fly - tipping with my hon. friend at a recent event hosted by the cla, which led me to take action to investigate the issue further. he will be aware that this is a long - term issue that needs to be tackled. fly - tipping really affects our country. that is why we have done more, and will continue to do more, to stamp out this anti - social crime that blights not only our countryside but our urban streets, and costs our economy greatly. my department works closely with organisations across government to tackle fly - tipping, including local authorities, the local government association, the environment agency, and the ministry of housing, communities and local government. we also encourage strong collaboration between local councils, the police, the environment agency, and local landowners and communities, to tackle this issue. my officials recently met a number of fly - tipping partnerships to discuss and review their models. we will work with the national fly - tipping prevention group to disseminate the information and increase collaboration and intelligence sharing on a local, regional and national scale. my officials are engaged with the police at a national level through the national police chiefs ' council, and with police and crime commissioners. indeed, tomorrow my officials will discuss fly - tipping with the police and crime commissioner for dorset, who is the fly - tipping lead for the national rural crime network.""]"

they represent us."", 'there are two aspects to the bill. the first is the offence of common assault, which i think is now drawn in such a way that the courts will be able to circumvent some of the arguments that have thus far been used to prevent any kind of successful prosecution. the second aspect relates to the aggravated offence, and the hon. gentleman is absolutely right that we have not included every single offence in the world. if amendment 3 is accepted this morning, i think that we will have included all offences that could relate to emergency workers. the minister was right to say that it is important that we take cognisance of the fact that, with this bill, we are saying that emergency workers are going to be treated slightly differently in law from the rest of the wider public. it is not that i want to create great hierarchies in society, with some people being more important than others ; it is that emergency workers are suffering these attacks and assaults because they are emergency workers, and that places a greater onus on us to ensure that they have the protections that they need. i return to amendment 2 and the question of whether spitting is common assault. the sentencing council has in recent years looked at whether spitting increases the culpability and seriousness of the offence, and it removed spitting from each of those categories in 2012. quite a lot of magistrates and judges have now started to say that this is one of the primary reasons that there has been a deflation in the number of successful prosecutions and in the sentences that are handed down. i regret the fact that spitting was removed by the sentencing council and hope that it will revisit that decision in the near future. i hope that the minister might also be able to say something about how we can ensure that the courts take spitting seriously as a part of common assault offences.']"

the question is the extent to which they can be tailored or lifted to suit appropriate local circumstances. first, however, let me say something about accessibility issues. our london taxis have a fantastic record : all 21, 000 are wheelchair - accessible, but the story is not the same across the country. i am told that in metropolitan areas outside london, 83 % of taxis are wheelchair - accessible, but in some rural areas the figure falls as low as 15 %. one of the challenges that we face is making our taxi and private hire fleet more accessible to people throughout the country. there is a lot of variation in the approach to disability awareness training, which only 41 % of local authorities require for taxi drivers and only 38 % require for private hire vehicle drivers. over the past few years, the percentage of local authorities that require taxi and private hire vehicle drivers to complete training on the subject of child sexual abuse or exploitation has risen to 70 %, partly in response to some very sad incidents in some parts of the country. however, that leaves nearly 100 licensing authorities that still do not require drivers to undertake such training. i became interested in the subject when i had the privilege of serving as a shadow transport minister for a couple of years. when i later had the opportunity to introduce a private member ' s bill, i chose to try to do something about safety issues, on which there is cross - party consensus. since i introduced my bill - the licensing of taxis and private hire vehicles ( safeguarding and road safety ) bill - some 18 months ago, i have had the opportunity to discuss the issue with enforcement officers and officials from knowsley to london and with taxi and private hire firms from brighton to manchester.""]"

lloyd, is in the gallery with her family. i am particularly pleased to be leading this debate, given the importance of the wider issue to our society and to the economy as a whole. increasing the availability of affordable childcare, particularly for younger children, is one of the key issues for many of britain ' s families, with a huge impact on their standard of living. as the joseph rowntree foundation highlighted after the publication of the 2017 childcare survey by the family and childcare trust last march : a€œthe biggest cost for many working households with children, after housing, is childcare. the cost of all types of childcare has risen much faster than overall inflation. the cost of childcare can affect the real increase in disposable income gained by a parent taking a job or working for more hours. this can affect families ' living standards directly and also indirectly by influencing whether parents work at all, what jobs they take and how much they work."", 'it would be helpful if hon. members did not just make up statistics and facts as they went along, as we just heard from the hon. lady. hon. members should listen to us regarding the support that we are now providing to claimants. as i said, it is a topsy - turvy world. there was a ding - dong when the opposition were calling for the changes. now that we are introducing the changes, we are back to another ding - dong and they do not want the changes - but never mind. i turn to the regulations concerning national insurance contributions and childcare. these regulations align the tax and national insurance treatment of employer - supported childcare, where parents opt into the new tax - free childcare scheme. they remove the national insurance disregard to new entrants to the scheme, once the relevant day has been set. they are vital to ensure that the tax system operates fairly and consistently and that the government can target their childcare support effectively. for many parents, being able to afford good - quality childcare is essential for them to work and support their families. that is why we are replacing the childcare vouchers with tax - free childcare, which is a fairer and better - targeted system. tax - free childcare is now open to all eligible parents, who can get up to a£2, 000 per child per year to help towards their childcare costs. more families will be able to access support through tax - free childcare because only about half of employed working parents can access vouchers, and self - employed parents were excluded from vouchers. therefore, 1. 5 million families are now eligible for tax - free childcare compared with about 600, 000 families currently benefiting from vouchers.', ""let me make my introductory remarks, and then i will give way. let me draw members ' attention to the three key reasons why we support the replacement of childcare vouchers with tax - free childcare. first, the government believe that childcare vouchers are unfair. tax - free childcare is fairer and better targeted than the voucher scheme. for example, only about 5 % of employers offer vouchers, which limits their reach to about half of working parents, not to mention that self - employed parents are completely excluded from the scheme, which pays no regard to the number of children in each family and disadvantages lone - parent families. secondly, tax - free childcare has a broader reach. it is open to all working families with children aged under 12 that meet the earnings criteria. that ensures that families who were excluded from childcare vouchers can be brought into tax - free childcare, and benefits families with the highest childcare costs - namely, most of those with young children. thirdly, tax - free childcare is simpler to use - i will come to the it issues that members raised. employers usually pay third - party providers to administer childcare voucher schemes. the government do not believe that paying third - party providers is a good use of taxpayers ' money. some a£220 million has gone on such administration since the scheme began. a voucher scheme is therefore an ineffective way of delivering support to families. under tax - free childcare, parents manage their own accounts online. the case for change is clear, as it was to the labour party when it announced at its 2009 conference, when it was in government, that the existing system would be shut down. i will now happily give way to the hon. lady.""]"

there is no equivalence and it is outrageous to suggest that there is. that is particularly the case given that some of the kids affected would face a hellish path to settlement, which the minister seems to be suggesting is a suitable alternative."", 'it is an honour to serve under your chairmanship, mr hollobone. i thank the hon. member for cumbernauld, kilsyth and kirkintilloch east ( stuart c. mcdonald ) for securing this debate and also the other members who have contributed. there appears to be a consensus that the amount charged is not acceptable. as of april this year, the cost of registering a child for citizenship was a£1, 012 - a 51 % increase since 2014. there are no exemptions, waivers, reductions or refunds for the fees, even though the secretary of state has the power to make provision for them. such outrageously high fees mean that children from poor and low - income families are prevented from accessing their right to citizenship. constantly increasing the price of an application makes it almost impossible to plan for future costs, and increases the chances of people losing status because they cannot afford the price. it is important to stress that the children would not be claiming anything. they are not paying for citizenship to be granted by the government, but for their existing entitlement to citizenship to be recognised. speaking to the home affairs select committee, the home secretary said the fee is, a€œa huge amount of money to ask children to pay for citizenshipa€. he said he woulda€œget around toa€looking at fees. my first question to the minister is : has anybody got around to looking at the issue yet? the aspect of fees that i personally have greatest difficulty with is the profit that the home office makes on the applications. of the a£1, 012 that is charged, a£372 is the cost of administration and almost two thirds is profit. the free movement website estimates that the home office has made nearly a£100 million in profits over the past five years.', 'if the hon. gentleman allows me to make some progress, i will turn to the points he made in his opening speech. during 2017 - 18, about 64, 000 people were granted indefinite leave to remain and 123, 000 were granted citizenship. of those granted citizenship, more than 28, 000 were minor children who were registered and were related to a british citizen, or children granted citizenship on a discretionary basis. in all cases the applicants either paid the due fee or had that fee paid on their behalf, reflecting the value placed on permanent residence and citizenship in the uk. the charging framework for visa and immigration services delivered a£1. 35 billion of income in the last financial year, 2017 - 18. that helped to fund more than a£620 million of costs associated with other immigration system functions, helping to maintain their effectiveness and security, and investment in ongoing service improvement. setting fees at above the cost of processing an application has also helped us to set some fees at below cost - for example, short - term visit visas, in recognition of the significant economic benefits that tourists and other visitors bring to the whole of the uk. the subsidy for the circa 2. 5 million short - term visit visas issued each year costs in the region of a£90 million per annum, which can be afforded only by setting a wide range of other fees. let me make one other obvious point : setting fees at the level that we do - putting the burden on those who benefit from the services - reduces the burden on the exchequer and on the general taxpayers of this country. it is easy, particularly in opposition, to call for fees or taxes to be reduced, but a responsible government must balance the books. the loss of income that would result from any reduction in fees would have to be made up elsewhere, and there have been rather fewer suggestions of how that might be achieved.']"

case scenario. that reflects the very challenging operating environment in eastern drc, which is a heavily populated area affected by insecurity. for example, last weekend an attack by armed groups on a monusco base was close to where a vaccination team were staying. thankfully, none of the ebola responders was injured, but they were moved to goma for a short period and vaccination activities had to be paused for a day. the scale of the response is also challenging. in addition to the 373 confirmed and probable cases, the drc government, supported by who and other implementing partners, is trying to trace some 4, 400 contacts on a daily basis. however, there is some encouraging news. the response is enabling faster detection of cases, laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of the spread of the disease.', ""first, i thank the minister for giving me advance sight of her statement. i share the government ' s deep concern about the outbreak of ebola in the democratic republic of the congo, and i am pleased to hear that a£25 million of uk aid has been given to the response. we hope that it goes some way to containing this deadly outbreak. in addition, supporting neighbouring countries to prepare to tackle the disease is fundamental and welcome. in 2014, we learned the hard way what happens when action is not taken fast enough to halt the cruel and deadly ebola virus. we all remember with great sadness how too many people tragically lost their lives in west africa, and none of us will ever forget the fear and chaos that the virus wreaked on the affected communities, and indeed right across the globe. i am sure we all agree that we must act now to avoid a repeat of those horrific scenes, and help the drc to contain this outbreak. with the world health organisation reporting that 213 people have died since 1 august in the drc, and the humanitarian agency ma©decins sans frontia¨res confirming 366 cases, let us be sure that dfid steps up and ensures that the uk plays a crucial leadership role alongside the international community in responding to this outbreak, just as we did in sierra leone four years ago. however, while emergency humanitarian response is an integral part of dfid ' s work, i am sure the minister agrees that prevention is better than emergency response. while we send aid to drc, we cannot and must not turn our backs on providing the long - term support that will ensure countries across the global south have appropriate health systems set up in the first place. it is deeply disappointing, therefore, that the minister ' s department dropped health spending from 18 % of dfid spend in 2014, to 12 % in 2017."", 'i will come on to the lessons learnt since the outbreak in sierra leone in a moment. however, i am sure that i cannot possibly have heard from the opposition front bench a statement to the effect that having a strong private sector is somehow in conflict with having the revenues needed to provide strong health systems around the world. i hope that that is not the considered position of those on the labour front bench. while spending on strengthening health systems around the world, particularly in some of the poorest and most fragile affected countries, it is important that we in the uk recognise the important role of growth and job creation in the ability of those countries to generate their own tax revenues so that they can continue to strengthen their own health systems. we think that that is the most important way to approach worldwide development. i digress from the topic at hand. the hon. lady mentions the outbreak in west africa. i draw the attention of the house to progress and lessons that have been learned since that outbreak. first, the importance of reacting quickly has been taken into account, both in the first outbreak in the drc earlier this year, which i am glad to say has been brought under control, and in this outbreak. importantly, the uk has ensured that the who has the resources it needs as soon as it needs them, because this is a clear case of where a quick reaction will save lives. one major milestone that has occurred since the outbreak in west africa is that the world has developed an experimental vaccine, which was deployed for the first time this year in the drc. it proved to be effective in the first outbreak. as i said, 31, 000 people have been given the experimental vaccine so far in this outbreak. one real challenge, however, is that this outbreak is in a conflict -

only a small number live in that very important community - and convincing him to leave because the back windows had dirt coming in and he was at risk of being crushed if he stayed in his own home. as the hon. member for angus mentioned, there are challenges in dealing with insurance companies. there is no doubt that we have significant challenges in coastal erosion the length and breadth of scotland and beyond, and it is vital that all the governments of the uk work together. i want to set the record straight on what the scottish government have done. i hope the hon. lady will be aware of the a£42 million a year that the scottish government have made available via the capital settlement since 2008 - that is, a£420 million - to enable local authorities to invest in flood prevention and coastal erosion works.', 'i thank my hon. friend for his intervention and i absolutely agree. there are huge studies going on in my constituency as well, because we need to do the groundwork, but we also need to have the funding ready for when those studies complete, so that we can go ahead with the work that needs to be done. of course, when it comes to coastal erosion, the waves do not respect local authority boundaries. erosion affects areas up and down the coastline and different local authorities face common and related problems. this is not something that should be left to local authorities alone ; there is space for a much more joined - up approach to erosion at all levels of government. however, such action must also be timely. i do not want to see montrose ending up as a cautionary tale for other parts of the coastline. unfortunately, the scottish government are risking that happening by leaving the implementation of further solutions to the 2022 to 2028 six - year plan for flood risk management. angus cannot wait until 2022, or until any time between 2022 and 2028. even by 2022, swathes of the angus coastline will have been lost. the risk of flooding and erosion to montrose, arbroath and other coastal communities in angus will be even more serious than it is today, and existing defences are being put under increasing and unbearable strain. it is the responsibility of local authorities, the devolved administrations and the uk government alike to start working together on the issue as a matter of urgency, so that we can quite literally hold back the tide that threatens so many of our coastal communities. the government are due to publish their updated national flood and coastal erosion risk management strategy next year, and within that i ask the minister to consider ways to make that work happen, ensuring that everyone involved in protecting our coasts around the whole uk is working effectively together.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered coastal erosion. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir david. the future of britain ' s coastline, and of our coastal communities, is finally getting the political attention that it deserves - not a moment too soon. from the need to curb plastic waste to prevent environmental damage to our shores to the opportunities that brexit presents for reviving our long - struggling fishing communities, britain ' s coasts are coming to the forefront of the political agenda. i am glad, because if our coastal communities are to benefit from this renewed focus on their future, we need to act now to ensure that they have a future. coastal erosion threatens large parts of britain ' s coasts and puts houses, businesses and entire communities at risk of flooding or, in some cases, total destruction. many hon. members will be familiar with this issue, as coastal erosion threatens about 17 % of the uk ' s coastline, specifically along the east coast. the environment agency estimates that more than 700 properties in england could be lost to coastal erosion by the 2030s, while in scotland, erosion is believed to pose a risk to a fifth of the coastline and the erosion rate has doubled since the 1970s. in 2013 and 2014, storms and extreme tides caused erosion that experts believed would never happen, but it has happened, and even quicker than they thought as it occurred almost overnight. businesses and individuals are increasingly concerned about the impact of the increasingly rapid degradation of our coastline. our coasts are vital areas and hubs of economic activity. as well as the obvious tourism draws, they are home to much of our crucial infrastructure. in scotland, the soft coastline, which is about 19 % of the total, and which is most at risk, includes roads, railways and scotland ' s water network.""]"

we do not even have that north of the border. pregnancies for women with pku are extremely high risk. we have a slightly odd fail - first approach in this country, which can lead to serious defects and lifelong disabilities for children if they survive the pregnancy. the cost to the nhs of treating those disabilities over the life of the child is significantly more than the cost of kuvan for the mother during pregnancy. we have an odd approach to cost - effectiveness when looking at medicines in this country that i think we need to reassess. that is not only true for kuvan ; we have seen it when talking about orkambi and for various other issues.', 'i absolutely agree. i hope that one of the good things that will come out of this debate is that the buck stops being passed, and the assessment gets done as quickly as possible. it is so important for people to have access to this drug ; we need that to be sorted. there is evidence that for a significant proportion of people with pku - about 25 % - this drug can significantly improve their condition. it does not cure it, but it does make it much easier to deal with the dietary issues, which have such an impact on the way people live their lives. despite the drug having been around for so long, nhs england has only recently considered it for the management of pku. the drug has now been referred to nice for assessment and technology appraisal. the appg on pku recently heard from nice about the process, but there is concern about the timescales and how the benefits of the treatment will be assessed. understandably, there is huge frustration on the part of the pku community that there are children and adults who could be benefiting from kuvan now, and there is substantial evidence to support its benefits. there is a particular issue about prescribing kuvan for pregnant women with pku, who can understandably find it hugely difficult to control their diet, and who fear the effect of any problems on their unborn child. while there is a 2013 commissioning policy in place that allows kuvan to be prescribed to some pregnant women, it can be difficult for women to be prescribed it in a timely way. some people, some of whom are in this room, have had access to kuvan through individual funding requests, or on a trial basis. those people have found real benefits from the drug. my constituent archie, who is here, started on the treatment earlier this year.']"

fenced, as it allows local authorities, which are independent of central government, to manage their budgets in line with local priorities. in practice, that means there is no specific funding stream for parks, just as there is not for waste services or children ' s services, for example. local communities are best placed to decide on their own local priorities."", 'i absolutely agree. that is the thrust of my speech tonight, and i have already detailed the effects of cuts to budgets for policing and public services. it would be easy to ask the minister to consider making parks statutory services, so that councils could be held to account more easily for their maintenance. however, my local parks would not be helped one bit by that without the government backing up the change with serious funding for local authorities to meet this requirement. labour and the conservatives have different views about local authority funding, and i do not think that we will resolve this difference tonight. as much as local authorities can innovate in developing and maintaining parks, it appears to be an unfortunate truth that there will always be higher costs. i ask the minister specifically to ensure that councils have enough capital funds to create parks that are resilient to the challenges they can face. i also ask him to work with the minister for sport to ensure that lottery funds specifically support parks facing difficulties with misuse and the lack of commercial income that i have outlined. as welcome as the a€œparks for peoplea€ programme was, its focus on heritage meant that parks in the most challenging areas sometimes lost out in favour of parks in traditionally leafier suburbs. i thank members and the minister for attending tonight. i also thank local people, interested organisations and local parks officers who all offered a wealth of information, so much of which i could not touch on tonight. i hope that i can make a small contribution to ensuring that we have resilient parks and green spaces in every part of my constituency and in every city. maintaining and improving parks for every citizen is an absolute necessity if we want to create a more equal, healthy and happy society.', ""even amidst the most built - up cities, we are blessed with parks and pockets of green space. those spaces improve air quality, lower temperatures near congested cities and even harbour wildlife, but they are also the lifeblood of our communities. as we face an obesity crisis and concerns over public health, parks offer free and accessible opportunities for exercise and enjoyment. at a time when families are living in ever more cramped conditions and unsuitable housing, parks provide a much - needed environment in which children without access to other opportunities can enjoy being children. in an era of extreme loneliness and isolation, they are bringing people of all ages together, and in an age of unprecedented privatisation and commercialisation of public space, they remain free for everyone to use and benefit from. according to the indices of multiple deprivation, my constituency is one of the most deprived in the country. government figures suggest that we might expect to see far fewer parks and open spaces in such areas than in wealthier areas. however, sheffield, brightside and hillsborough, despite its legacy as a highly urban formerly industrial area, is an exception to this, having substantial areas of parks and open space across the constituency. sheffield can lay claim to being the greenest city in europe, with a third of our city boundary lying within the peak district and a history of prestigious prizes won, including the 2005 entente florale gold medal. we are blessed with hundreds of parks and open spaces, and residents have access to a huge range of facilities, from small play parks to ancient woodlands. the national trust funded research in 2016 on sheffield ' s parks, which highlighted the huge value and benefit they hold for local people and the financial value that they represent to health and other public services.""]"

it must be separate from the nhs to ensure real independence, and it must investigate and act on concerns. if a local investigation has failed or is failing, there should be a mechanism to report that to an independent body. if we get to the point where there is simply a slanging match within a trust, there will never be a satisfactory resolution, so arbitration needs to come in and look at the cold facts and the original facts of the disclosure. often, what is looked at is the process, but not whether the whistleblower was actually right to raise an issue in the first place. it is critical that whistleblowers are protected from detriment from the moment of speaking up. they should be protected during the investigation, and they must not be picked on either subtly, as the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) said, or blatantly - they must not lose their jobs. it is important that legal penalties for reprisals against whistleblowers can actually be enforced. there should be a system of redress for whistleblowers that does not involve litigation. litigation is expensive for the nhs and the whistleblower, and is utterly confrontational.']"

hong kong relationship has deepened. more than 600 uk businesses with registered offices in hong kong, an export market worth a£8. 6 billion and a uk investment stake of more than a£33 billion are clear signs that trade is booming. in terms of academic and cultural exchange, more hong kong students are enrolling at uk universities than ever before, which is an achievement to celebrate. in part, the relationships we form with students, young people and young democrats redouble our efforts to commit ourselves to a more socially just society based on individual freedoms and human rights. we are all aware of the high - profile cases raised in connection with the topic of the debate, including the arrests of the booksellers.""]"

principally in ireland, spain, france and cyprus - and their dependent relatives is protected. in addition, uk residents who visit the eu or the european economic area on holiday or to study may use the european health insurance card to access healthcare for emergency treatment and healthcare needs that arise during their stay. anyone who is ordinarily resident in the uk qualifies for an ehic and 250, 000 claims for medical treatment are made each year under this scheme. by the same token, eu nationals visiting the uk can use their ehic to receive free care from the nhs for any emergency healthcare needs and for healthcare needs that arise during their stay. i am grateful to the hon. member for chelmsford ( vicky ford ) for reminding the house that the card does not cover repatriation and other associated expenses, but visitors to the eu can currently be reassured that their immediate emergency costs will be met. that is something that we would seek to protect. by means of the s1 form and the ehic, current arrangements also provide for the healthcare of employees of uk companies and organisations working in the eu and the eea, as well as for that of frontier workers living there, and vice versa. importantly, the agreement also provides funding for uk residents to travel overseas to receive planned treatment in other countries - for example, for procedures unavailable in the uk within a medically justifiable timescale, or to return home to give birth.', 'i beg to move, that the bill be now read a second time. this is a short bill, with six clauses, to enable continuity of healthcare for british nationals and eu citizens after britain leaves the european union. it is clearly in the interests of the british public to ensure reciprocal healthcare arrangements continue when we leave the eu, whether that happens through an agreement with the eu itself or through individual agreements with eu member states. by enabling us to implement those arrangements, the bill will help us to help nearly 200, 000 british pensioners living in eu countries to continue to access the medical treatment that they need, and it will mean that the hundreds of thousands of british citizens who require medical treatment each year during holidays in europe can still be covered for medical assistance when they need it. the bill will help to ensure that uk nationals who live and work in eu countries can continue to access healthcare on the same basis as local people. it will mean that eu citizens can be covered for reciprocal healthcare here, so that the uk continues to be a place tourists want to visit and vital workers, such as our nhs workforce, want to live in. the bill will also mean that we can continue to recover healthcare costs from europe as we do now.', ""it is a real pleasure to follow my hon. friend the member for walsall north ( eddie hughes ). like him, i am optimistic about securing a brexit deal and continuing our international healthcare arrangements. since the 1950s, the uk and its european neighbours have had reciprocal healthcare and social security arrangements, and i have personally made use of many of them, having spent years living and working in european countries. good reciprocal healthcare arrangements give peace of mind to all of us, and they will be important as we continue. current arrangements give all uk nationals a sense of security and the knowledge that they can access the healthcare they need when they live, study, work or travel across europe. the same applies to eu citizens when they are in the uk. healthcare co - operation is therefore actively supporting business and tourism by removing a barrier to people ' s life choices. arguably the greatest beneficiaries of these arrangements are our citizens who live on the continent, many of whom are enjoying their golden years in the sun. the framework put in place by the bill will ensure that the secretary of state has the necessary power to maintain or negotiate arrangements in any brexit eventuality. one of my constituents recently emphasised the importance of having these arrangements. his grandmother, who is now over 80, lives alone in france. a few years ago, she had a car accident that left her seriously injured. she required an operation and spent over a month in hospital. that was followed up by time in a convalescent home. all that care would have cost a small fortune but, luckily for her, she enjoys healthcare under the european health insurance card s1 route. access to that is fundamental to her and to the other 190, 000 pensioners like her, particularly as their health needs may increase over time. the bill should calm the anxieties of our citizens abroad. it will also save the taxpayer money.""]"

will the minister tell me if any geothermal projects have been awarded to contracts for difference during either of the allocation rounds to date? there are mature geothermal renewable technologies providing heat and electricity that should and must play their part in the decarbonisation of our energy networks.""]"

mhra - uses that name, i will use it to cover all five of them collectively. originally, isotretinoin was marketed as a chemotherapy drug. based on the evidence of friends who have undergone chemotherapy, i am immediately warned to watch out for side effects. i do not suffer any more from teenage acne or have the urgent need to get it under control that could easily make me overcome misgivings in a bid to get rid of such a curse. the effects of isotretinoin were last debated on 3 december 2013 in this very place. i took part in that debate because i was concerned to hear about the effects of isotretinoin on the nephew of one of my then constituents. worries about the effects of isotretinoin had been debated in parliament some 10 years before that. this seems to be a problem that will not go away and for which we have no scientifically based answer. i was spurred to call this debate by a constituent who prefers to remain anonymous, but whose son - a totally happy young man - has had his life totally disrupted since taking isotretinoin for severe acne.', 'i too was expecting to come later in the order of speeches - christmas has come early for me. happy christmas to everyone, and thank you to all the staff who run this place. i have said that now, so i will not repeat it. i want to raise the subject of the danger caused by a drug called isotretinoin, which i have already spoken about - perhaps four times - in the house since becoming an mp. to date, i have to say, the collective view of the house has had little impact on actually sorting it out. isotretinoin, also known as accutane or roaccutane, is a drug used to treat severe acne primarily in teenagers - mainly boys. it has dramatic effects : it clears acne up pretty quickly, but its side - effects can be enormous. it can cause severe depression and impotence in those who use it. my concerns stem from contact with constituents, particularly one lady. she is the mother of a young man who has suffered enormously from isotretinoin. at the age of 16, he was given the drug for eight months. as a result, he suffered - forgive my language - complete erectile dysfunction, which has had a life - changing effect on him and, indeed, on his mental state. he is now in his early 20s, and it has of course had a dramatic effect on him. he has been through university, too. unsurprisingly, his mother is distraught, in particular because her son is now almost unwilling even to discuss the matter. i believe that we can all understand that. it must be very difficult for a young man to discuss such a matter with his mother. i, personally - i know i am from another generation - could not even have dreamt of talking about such a matter with my mother.']"

i think, and our committee agrees - in a far too narrow way. the charity commission guidance for students unions indicated that it would consider it acceptable for charitable students unions to comment ona€œstreet lighting near the campusa€because the issue affects students as students, and therefore fulfils their charitable purposes. the charity commission would consider it unacceptable for students unions to comment publicly on issues that do not directly affect the welfare of students as students, such as, a€œthe treatment of political prisoners in a foreign country. a€that is the charity commission ' s own example, illustrating the point raised by my hon. friend the member for stafford. the minister told our committee that the charity commission guidance shoulda€œgo further and facilitate the promotion of free speech. it should be giving students ' unions the permission to host debates about controversial issues and expose students to a wide range of viewpoints. that should be the core purpose. a€that is quite right."", ""that is an excellent example. i hope it will also encourage students to the right of karl marx, because i have spoken to a number of students who have recently said, a€œi wouldn ' t admit to being a conservative on campus. a€our committee concluded that the concept of safe spaces, having been extended to entire university campuses, is unhelpful. it is not only unhelpful. if minority views are supressed across the whole campus, but they are not views that are promoting terrorism or inciting the kind of activity i referred to earlier, the concept is actually against the law, impinging on the right to free speech under article 10 of the european convention on human rights. a number of students unions tried to argue in evidence to us that it was necessary to limit speakers who cause harm through speech - harm caused because people might find speech disturbing or upsetting. as our report says, however, this is counter or detrimental to free speech. regarding safe spaces, we say : a€œwhilst there must be opportunities for genuinely sensitive and confidential discussions in university settings, and whilst the original intention behind safe space policies may have been to ensure that minority or vulnerable groups can feel secure, in practice the concept of safe spaces has proved problematic, often marginalising the views of minority groups. they need to co - exist with and respect free speech. they cannot cover the whole of the university or university life without impinging on rights to free speech... when that happens, people are moving from the need to have a a€œsafe spacea€ to seeking to prevent the free speech of those whose views they disagree with. minority groups or individuals holding unpopular opinions which are within the law should not be shut down nor be subject to undue additional scrutiny by students ' unions or universities."", ""this inquiry is one of the most important that we have undertaken in my three years on the joint committee on human rights. as we have heard, we received some very disturbing evidence. free speech is indeed a foundation for democracy in society, and universities are places where many of tomorrow ' s leaders learn how to explore ideas in a way that prepares them to engage in and influence wider society, so it is critical that free speech is secured in universities. a key part of all students ' education is the ability to engage in dialogue and contentious debate. universities have a legal duty under the education act to secure freedom of speech within the law, both for students and for visiting speakers. if we do not prepare students to engage in dialogue in an environment that promotes free speech, there is a serious danger that we will risk promoting extremism and factionalism within wider society. only by understanding different views and beliefs and by, as one of our witnesses said, countering bad ideas with good ones, will we build community cohesion and break down prejudice and discrimination in wider society, which, at worst, as we know, can lead to violent disturbances within our local communities. that is something that none of us wants. indeed, it is one of the purposes of the prevent strategy. it is ironic that the strategy is in many ways defeating one of its key objectives in the way that it is applied at universities. i will come on to that in more detail shortly. for the record, i will set the legal scene, which the committee is now well versed in. article 9 of the european convention on human rights states that, a€œeveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.""]"

women must have confidence when reporting rape that they will be believed and taken seriously, and that they will have justice. there has been a 72 % increase in the number of cases that have been administratively finalised - meaning the police have closed them after receiving advice from the cps. a guardian article on 24 september quoted a whistleblower who said that prosecutors were being told toa€œditch ' rape cases to improve figuresa€. that advice could severely limit victims ' access to justice and lead to cases involving younger victims, students or those with mental health issues being less likely to result in a charge. the overwhelming majority of rape victims still choose not to report to the police for fear of not being believed, yet the prevailing narrative in some sections of the media is that lying about rape is common. the opposite is true. only 17 % of those who experience sexual violence report it to the police, according to figures from the office for national statistics for march 2017. the cps estimated in 2012 that only 3 % of the 1, 149 cases heard may have been malicious. juries view evidence through the lens of prevailing stereotypes shared with the wider community. rape myths still dominate in our culture, including that a woman who has drunk a lot cannot complain if she is raped, that it is rape only if someone has injuries, that real rapes are done by strangers in alleyways, that it is a crime of passion and that women invite rape by what they wear. research shows that stereotypes about how rape victims are expected to behave remain prevalent in society and, by extension, in juries. there is still a lack of understanding about why a woman might not report an assault immediately or might not fight, or how a victim of a sexual assault might behave in the immediate aftermath of an attack. there are still huge gaps in the public understanding about what sexual consent actually means."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered rape myths and juries. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr hosie. in august, i submitted a freedom of information request to the crown prosecution service about the conviction rates for rape. the answer revealed that less than a third of prosecutions brought against young men result in a conviction. men aged 18 to 24 in england and wales are consistently less likely to be found guilty than older men. only 32 % were convicted last year - the lowest of any age group. successful prosecutions against men aged 25 to 59 were much higher at 46 %. the guardian used those figures in its recent excellent series on rape. given the vast majority of rapes are acquaintance or date rape, the conviction figures suggest a reluctance by juries to find young men guilty of rape. we need to explore the reasons behind that and how rape myths, stereotypes and attitudes affect juries. the rates may reflect the prevailing attitudes in society, and therefore of juries, towards young women, who are often blamed for their own rape. the number of men charged with rape in england and wales has fallen to its lowest level in a decade - a 23 % decline in 2017 - 18, according to the crown prosecution service ' s annual a€œviolence against women and girls reporta€. yet at the same time, the number of rapes reported to the police soared to more than 41, 000 in 2016 - 17, with a massive 150 % increase in the last five years. despite fewer charges, there was a 13 % fall in prosecutions and a 12 % decrease in convictions.""]"

definition of gender is already happening. organisations seem to be ahead of the law, which the government may or may not be about to change. there is a particular concern about what is going on in schools with children.', ""i am sure the hon. gentleman ' s comments will slightly reassure the transgender community. the uk ' s legislation is so out of date that we are no longer considered a world leader on lgbt + rights. we were once no. 1 -

14 to 2015 - 16, and the subsequent freeze on the majority of social security payments, have caused low - income households to suffer a significant deterioration in the adequacy of social security support. the freeze to payments and support is having a detrimental impact on millions of people on low incomes across the uk. inflation has more than doubled in the past year. it hit 3. 1 % in november, and it is now at 2. 7 %."", ""i will try to be brief. i am bewildered about what this debate is supposed to achieve. the hon. member for ayr, carrick and cumnock ( bill grant ) agreed with many of the points we put to him -

the scottish commission on social security - and we have a legal duty to scrutinise proposals for regulations and have regard to human rights. the new agency will seek medical information at the outset of an application - applicants will not be required to collect it at appeal stage - so face - to - face assessments will be reduced. the legislative process required to deal with the successful transition of 11 benefits is still going on in holyrood, so there may be more detail to come. those who contradict the hon. member for ayr, carrick and cumnock are not restricted to snp members. i am keen to quote a couple of his colleagues in the scottish parliament. on 19 december, the tory spokes -

if a palestinian is arrested, they are tried in a separate military court. access to justice is segregated. a child ' s nationality and ethnicity determine the type of justice that they receive under israel ' s occupation. after sentencing, nearly 60 % of palestinian child detainees are transferred from the occupied territories to the prisons of israel, in violation of the fourth geneva convention. that means that most will be unable to receive family visits, due to the freedom of movement restrictions placed on palestinians and the long time that it takes to issue a visiting permit."", ""it is a pleasure to speak in such an important debate, and i congratulate my hon. friend the member for rotherham ( sarah champion ) on securing it. it is important that this debate is grounded in, and based on, human rights for children. the glaring gaps in basic human rights protection for palestinian children held in israel ' s military detention system damages respect for the international rule of law and creates an environment that enables routine ill treatment and lack of justice. as we have already heard, the majority of children are taken from their homes in the occupied west bank during the middle of the night. heavily armed soldiers take the children away and several hours later they turn up in detention or interrogation centres alone, sleep - deprived, bruised and scared. interrogations tend to be coercive and include verbal abuse, threats and physical violence that ultimately result in a confession. even if we argue that 16 to 17 - year - olds are not children, which is incorrect, we must accept that any form of human rights abuse is abhorrent and should not be condoned in any way. most palestinian minors arrested by israel claim to have experienced physical violence during detention. recently the defence for children international palestine detailed the scale of incidents and the type of abuse experienced by the palestinian children whom they managed to speak to during around 60 visits to israeli prisons in 2017. some 75 % of children were subject to physical abuse, 25 % were denied adequate food and 100 % were denied the right to have their families at their interrogation. that is not something new. according to the latest data provided by the israeli prison service, at the end of november, 313 children - i am talking about children - were held in military detention. data for december 2017 have not been provided, but i suspect there will be a bit of a spike following mr trump ' s decision to move the embassy to jerusalem."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered military detention of palestinian children by israeli authorities. it is a genuine pleasure to serve under your chairmanship in this very important debate, mr stringer. i strongly welcome the fact that the government addressed the issue of palestinian child detainees during the third universal periodical review of israel at the un human rights council two weeks ago. they recommended that israel takea€œaction to protect child detainees, ensuring the mandatory use of audio - visual recording in interrogations with all child detainees, ending the use of painful restraints, and consistently fully informing detainees of their legal rights. a€that important statement signals a positive intent to engage constructively with this issue. i called this debate in the same spirit : i want to support and encourage israel to meet its international obligations regarding the rights of children. it meets them fully for israeli citizens but, alas, does not do so for palestinian children. to be clear, i am not making a judgment about the crimes palestinian children are alleged to have committed or about israel ' s right to uphold the law. this debate is specifically focused on palestinian children in military detention. two years ago, i secured a similar debate. i would love to tell the house that many of the issues discussed then have now been addressed, but sadly the situation remains largely the same. in march 2013, unicef published a report entitled a€œchildren in israeli military detention : observations and recommendationsa€, which concluded thata€œthe ill - treatment of children who come in contact with the military detention system appears to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized throughout the process, from the moment of arrest until the child ' s prosecution and eventual conviction and sentencing. a€""]"

i am seeking a commitment from the commonwealth games federation to include shooting in the 2026 games. we need to look forward and ensure that what has happened this time does not happen again. the minister referred to david calvert in her intervention. he will shortly be competing in brisbane, and my hon. friend the member for belfast east ( gavin robinson ) was inspired by him many years ago. i am sure that many other young boys and girls were inspired by him as well. that is why i am raising this issue today. two key international bodies oversee the shooting sports that appear in the commonwealth games : the international shooting sport federation and the international confederation of fullbore rifle associations. both have indicated a willingness to work with the cgf to find a solution to keep shooting sports in the games and on the 2022 programme. both are willing to do more than most, and representatives met the cgf president in february this year. this is about finding solutions. when people come to me with problems, it is not about the problem ; it is about the solution. we bring the issue to the floor of the house to seek a solution, and we hope that that solution will be forthcoming. at olympic level, the issf represents a category c sport, recognising its growing and significant contribution to the olympic ideals and family. having four disciplines, shooting sports can be delivered flexibly, both in terms of which disciplines appear and in terms of location.', ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the removal of shooting sports from birmingham 2022 commonwealth games. it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr hanson. i would like to push forward with the efforts started by the hon. member for strangford ( jim shannon ) - i am pleased to see him present - to make the case for the reinstatement of shooting sports at the 2022 commonwealth games in birmingham. i have picked up many of the points raised during his adjournment debate, and i will expand on them in the wake of the home nations ' phenomenal performance at the gold coast commonwealth games this year. the decision not to include shooting in the 2022 commonwealth games in birmingham has left many in the uk, particularly in my constituency, confused and unhappy. the matter is of particular importance to a constituent of mine, david mcmath, a 21 - year - old young man who recently won gold in the men ' s double trap competition at the games this year. he set a games record with a total of 74 - four ahead of his nearest rival, tim kneale from the isle of man, who took silver. without a doubt, shooting is a source of extreme national pride for the home nations of the united kingdom, as it is one of our strongest sports. in fact, we are the second strongest group in shooting events and managed to collect 38 % of the medals on offer this year. not adding shooting to the 2022 games has taken away 57 medal opportunities. every one of the home nations and channel islands participated in the shooting events, which proves the sport ' s popularity. in fact, it was the only sport for which the isle of man won a medal this year."", 'the hon. gentleman makes very good points and i agree with him. manchester used bisley in 2002, although it is 215 miles from the shooting ground. i therefore argue that it can be done and that bisley can provide the required facilities. i concede that bisley is not in tip - top condition, but the venue remains fully operational and would require only light modernisation to bring it up to scratch. with 95 % of the competition venues already in place, minor refurbishment of the bisley shooting ground would not add an unfeasible workload to the games organisers. a second solution is to build a new site alongside the new national shooting centre for which uk sport and british shooting are currently securing funding and planning permission. if the organisers of the birmingham games were to link funding to the national governing body, it would be a fantastic opportunity to ensure that the games leave a lasting legacy. shooting is currently on a list of optional sports, from which the host city must choose seven. the organisers of birmingham 2022 have opted to include table tennis, for which england has only ever won 15 medals. that pales in comparison with the 168 medals won for shooting. they have also opted for 3x3 basketball, which is a novelty in the commonwealth games. i think shooting is a more important sport. given that i have just presented a counter - argument and an alternative option to the venue issue cited by the birmingham organisers, i see no logical reason why england would want to cheat herself of a significant number of medals by removing shooting from the agenda. shooting has been on the commonwealth games agenda at every games bar 1970. it was originally introduced in 1966 and, as my hon. friend the member for wyre forest ( mark garnier ) has said, it is one of the most diverse and inclusive sports on offer.']"

we are certainly in agreement about that. the government truly believe in and recognise the power of the arts to transform places and, indeed, people ' s lives. i passionately believe that and know it to be true. as the hon. gentleman will know, arts council england rightly operates at arm ' s length from the government. in those circumstances, it would be wrong for a minister of the crown to intervene in, or comment too specifically on, individual funding cases. i shall therefore begin by discussing the arts council ' s role and the support that it provides at a broader level. the arts council ' s mission is a€œgreat art and culture for everyonea€, which it seeks to achieve through advocacy and investment in line with its 10 - year plan. it works to make the arts, and the wider culture of museums and libraries, an integral part of everyday public life, accessible to all and understood as essential to the national economy and the health and happiness of society. on the hon. gentleman ' s specific point, the arts council has worked very hard in recent years to ensure that investment outside london has increased as a percentage and in cash terms. he will be pleased to hear that last year some 70 % of arts council funding was awarded outside london. between 2018 and 2022, an additional a£170 million will be invested outside london."", ""the fact of the matter is that the arts council has made significant progress, as i have outlined, in delineating moneys outside the london area. it is also important that my department and i access all people throughout england. arts council england is focused on that too. i should like to take this opportunity to congratulate sue williamson, who joins the arts council as director of libraries from st helens library service, which i referred to a moment ago. she most recently delivered its award - winning cultural hubs and arts in libraries programme, and oversaw the successful application to the arts council ' s national portfolio. another arts council - funded scheme is first art, which is a collective of four cultural and community organisations working within former coalfields in north - east derbyshire and north - east nottinghamshire. it aims to bring inspiring cultural experiences within reach of everyone in ashfield, bolsover, mansfield and north - east derbyshire over the next two years. it is a very exciting programme. the hon. member for bassetlaw raised the issue of funding for coalfield communities at prime minister ' s questions a few weeks ago, when he alleged an inequality of funding by comparing funding for coalfield communities with funding in the london borough of islington, which he mentioned again this evening. i am happy to correct that assertion on the record. having read his letter to me following prime minister ' s questions, i see that his figures are based on the arts council ' s national portfolio funding only, which led to the conclusion of a discrepancy in funding. in actual fact, although the national portfolio organisation funding is an incredibly important part of the arts council ' s work - it provides regular funding over a set period to some of england ' s most vital cultural institutions - it is by no means the only form of funding it distributes.""]"

when will sir charles godfray ' s review of the government ' s tb policy be published? will it consider the use of vaccination as an alternative to shooting? some horrific video footage has been obtained from the badger cull area in cumbria. a caged badger was shot and took almost a minute to die, writhing in agony. the shooter then flagrantly disregarded the biosecurity guidelines, took the badger out of the cage and failed to bag it up - little wonder that the government ' s policy has not been particularly successful in reducing the spread of tb."", ""i beg to move, that this house has considered the badger cull. it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, sir david, in a debate on this very important issue, because i know that you take a close interest in it. however, i am amazed that five years after the badger cull started we are still debating it. if you will bear with me, sir david, i remember speaking on this issue on 5 june 2013. i quoted lord krebs, who chaired a review team that originated the idea of the randomised badger culling trial. he was interviewed on the a€œtodaya€ programme on 12 october 2012, and said : a€œthe scientific case is as clear as it can be : this cull is not the answer to tb in cattle. a€i have found no scientists who are experts in population biology or in the distribution of infectious diseases in wildlife who think that culling is a good idea. people seem to have cherry - picked certain results to try to support their argument. i also quoted lord robert may, a former government chief scientist and president of the royal society, who said : a€œit is very clear to me that the government ' s policy does not make sense... i have no sympathy with the decision. they are transmuting evidence - based policy into policy - based evidence. a€another former government chief scientist, professor sir john beddington, also refused to back the cull. more than 30 scientists signed a letter that was published in the observer on 14 october 2012 and states thata€œthe complexities of tb transmission mean that licensed culling risks increasing cattle tb rather than reducing ita€. the letter ends by saying, a€œculling badgers as planned is very unlikely to contribute to tb eradication. a€"", ""i am disappointed that the minister did not give way at the end. i think it is very unfair to characterise the situation as being the fault of the previous labour government. let us remember that it was the previous labour government who - rather controversially - actually backed the randomised badger cull tests from which the conclusion was drawn that the way to tackle bovine tb was not through a badger cull. i repeat that the body of evidence from the scientists involved in the randomised badger cull tests showed that carrying on with the badger cull could have made matters worse. we have seen over the last five years of this horrific cull, which continues, that, even putting the appalling cruelty to one side, it is simply not working. it is all very well for the minister to get up and say that various peer - reviewed reports have implied that it has worked, but the evidence speaks for itself. how can the minister stand there and say that it has worked when the proportion of tb in cattle herds is virtually the same as at the start of the cull, and when it has even spread to other areas? the government are looking in the wrong direction. i heard what the minister said, but i implore him to go back and look again at pursuing a different route, at the cattle movements, at the fraud that takes place, at biosecurity and at doing proper testing and supporting farmers in doing so, rather than expecting them to stump up for the bill. this is an appalling state of affairs. i repeat that there is no scientific evidence to support the government ' s position. public opinion is overwhelmingly opposed to the badger cull, which does not serve the farming community in any way, shape or form and certainly does not serve the interests of wildlife in our country.""]"

we have got to get it right in our own hospitals and across the nhs and the whole united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland, and then we can look further afield to other countries. he reminds me that last year i had occasion to be in hospital three times for various operations. i never had any infections. i had nothing but the best care. the surgeon ' s knife went in the right direction and removed what had to removed. it was important to do that. the important thing is that we have hospitals and an nhs that are excellent. when the nhs works well, it is the best in the world, but sometimes we need to think about things. the cost of infections to the nhs includes the immediate costs of treating patients in hospital, bed - blocking and so on. there are also issues with hospital capacity, which has reached 100 % in some cases. the world health organisation estimates that 50 % to 70 % of hospital - acquired infections are transmitted by hands, so improving hand hygiene must play a central role in any strategy to reduce hospital infections. it would be remiss of me not to note the work carried out by the secretary of state to improve patient safety in the nhs - let us give credit where credit is due. in november 2016, there was a commitment to halve gram - negative infections by 2020. the secretary of state announced he would appoint a new national infection prevention lead, dr ruth may. both are important steps in bringing down infection rates and show a commitment to do so. given that 50 % to 70 % of hospital infections are transmitted by hands, i was encouraged to see alongside those measures a commitment for the nhs to publish staff hand hygiene indicators for the first time.""]"

the promoters may not thank me for saying this - it should not be the case that, for example, the commissioners ' mates or one particular group end up finding themselves on the navigation advisory committee. however, the promoters were happy to accept the idea that relevant interests should be declared and that there should be clear processes for how that works."", ""i am pleased to respond on the opposition ' s behalf to this opposed private business. although it might not be the most conventional way to introduce legislative change, and i have heard the detailed reservations of the hon. member for christchurch ( sir christopher chope ), we are none the less satisfied that the bill makes sense, and our intention is to support the bill as it stands. although the bill is fairly narrow in scope, we acknowledge that it has important consequences for those who will be affected. we are satisfied that due scrutiny has taken place in committee and is taking place at consideration stage this afternoon. the middle level of the fens was first drained in the 17th century to reclaim an area of farmland in cambridgeshire and west norfolk. the middle level commissioners are the navigation authority for the waterways, established through a series of local acts passed between 1663 and 1874, so we appreciate that the legislative framework underpinning the role of the commissioners is in need of an update. this is not least because almost all the fenland within the middle level waterways is below sea level, and if it was not for a complex system of flood mitigation and drainage schemes managed by the commissioners, the waterways could pose a significant risk to the estimated 100, 000 people who live and work in the area. in the simplest terms, the bill will introduce a registration scheme for vessels in the middle level and allow the commissioners to bring in revenue from boat owners that will be used to improve the waterways. the environment agency, the canal and river trust and the broads authority all have similar powers in respect of their own navigations, so in many ways, the bill is long overdue in bringing the middle level into line with its neighbours."", ""members will be pleased to know that i can be relatively brief. the government support the bill, which is promoted by the middle level commissioners, a statutory corporation constituted under the middle level act 1862. we have had a good debate this evening and i commend the many probing amendments that my hon. friend the member for christchurch ( sir christopher chope ) tabled, but i believe that all the points he raised have been dealt with comprehensively, in particular by my hon. friend the member for torbay ( kevin foster ), who has a deep grasp of all the detail of the bill. the legal framework that governs the commissioners ' navigation function is made up of a number of 18th and 19th century acts, which are now considerably out of date and do not align with modern requirements or the statutory framework that is applicable to other navigation authorities. in particular, the current legal framework that governs the commissioners does not include adequate provision for the registration of vessels using the waterways or the levying of charges for the use of the waterways and associated facilities. as a result, the commissioners do not receive any income from the navigation of the waterways, which has meant that moneys raised through drainage rates and levies have had to be used to fund navigation rather than for flood defence purposes, which is contrary to government policy. the commissioners are therefore seeking to update and clarify their powers to enable them to properly regulate and fund their waterways. the powers that they are seeking are similar to those used by other large inland navigation authorities, for example the canal and river trust, the environment agency and the broads authority. i very much support the bill and hope that it will pass unamended this evening.""]"

it is worth noting at this point that the government have in many ways been very supportive of cornwall in recent times. we are seeing record levels of investment in our transport infrastructure, and cornwall remains the only rural county to have been given a devolution deal by the government. however, when it comes to the specific matter of recognition of the cornish as a people, there is still a great deal to do."", 'i am deeply honoured to be able to make the case tonight for celebrating cornish identity and to call for the inclusion of cornish identity to be recognised in the next census in 2021. i am very grateful for the support of many of my cornish colleagues here in the house this evening. there is no doubt or debate over the fact that the cornish are a proud people who share an extraordinary history that can be traced back thousands of years. in calling for this debate to make the case for a cornish tick box for national identity in the next census, there is a risk that some may see this as some sort of gimmick designed simply to boost our tourist industry or play into a stereotype of cornish country folk. nothing could be further from the truth. although it is true to say that many of us cornish can be guilty of having a playful jibe at the english, especially those from devon - after all they do put their jam and cream on the wrong way round on their scones - this is not a whim or some notion based on a romantic view of the past. the cornish have, along with our welsh cousins, the longest history of any people in britain, dating back 12, 000 years. it is believed that these ancient people entered this isle after the ice age from the area now occupied by the basques. genetic codes indelibly mark the cornish with the dna of their ancient ancestors. it is believed that a staggering 80 % of the cornish retain this genetic marker. the cornish language, which is seeing a revival in recent times, has a 5, 000 - year history. we in cornwall have our own culture and our own ways. cornwall even has its own patron saint, st piran, whose life is celebrated on 5 march every year. we have our own flag and even our own tartan, which i am modelling so well with my tie this evening.', ""i am grateful to my cornish colleague for that intervention and for pointing out the hon. member for wycombe, who in fact attended the same school as me in cornwall, so we have a great deal in common. he makes a very good point. this is not just about people currently living in cornwall ; it is about the right and opportunity for people across the country who count themselves cornish - maybe by birth ; maybe by ancestry - to identify themselves as cornish. the point has been made that there is the option under a€œothera€ in the census to write a€œcornisha€ as one ' s nationality. in fact, in 2011 a staggering 73, 000 cornish men and women chose to do so. i should declare an interest in saying that i was one of those 73, 000 people. an interesting comparison is worth noting. those 73, 000 people represent about 14 % of the residents of cornwall. that is the same percentage of welsh residents who wrote a€œwelsha€ under the a€œothera€ option in the 2001 census. in 2001, the inclusion of a specific tick box for a€œwelsha€ increased the percentage of people identifying as welsh from 14 % to 66 %. i am convinced that if a tick box was provided, we would see a similar increase in the percentage of people choosing cornish as their identity. a dropdown menu provision for a€œothera€ is not good enough. recognition by way of a tick box will not only satisfy those of us in the far west but enhance the accuracy of the census by allowing the many thousands of cornish men and women from across the uk - the cornish diaspora - to know that they can declare their cornish identity. gleaning accurate data is surely what the census is all about.""]"

they must rely on private investment from owners and the support of local businesses. they need the watchful eye of the english football league to ensure that owners abide by the rules and that clubs are living within their financial means. clubs need the help of their local councils for the use of stadiums, and of course they need the fans as a regular source of income and ongoing appeal. football clubs need to be run as businesses, but if a company cannot guarantee a product, its customers go elsewhere. clubs are not like that. they are built on fan loyalty passed through families and generations ;

drawn carriages and submarines should have been covered by the bill - we thank them for that. some of our learned labour colleagues in the other place were more than qualified to speak about this topic, as one is a former airline pilot and another the president of the british airline pilots association. i pay particular tribute to them for their work on this issue, and we thank the government for the technical amendments that they tabled in response to the concessions that we won. i reiterate the point that our colleagues in the other place made about enforcement. we have over 21, 000 fewer police officers compared with in 2010.', 'the bill has been much improved by the persistence of our labour colleagues in the other place. i am sure that the whole house would want to join me in sending condolences to my hon. friend the member for kingston upon hull east ( karl turner ). he had been leading for the opposition on the bill, but he has just lost his father, the distinguished hull city councillor ken turner. our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family today. as no amendments were tabled, i shall highlight a few points in the bill itself. it is a short bill, consisting of two substantive and two procedural clauses. clause 1 makes it an offence to direct or shine a laser beam towards a vehicle or a person in charge of a vehicle in such a way as to dazzle or distract the person driving, piloting, navigating or otherwise in control of the vehicle when it is moving or is ready to move. it results from an amendment tabled by labour colleagues in the other place. there may be mitigating circumstances if it can be proved that the use of the laser was necessary in, for example, a rescue mission to attract attention of a pilot, or that the offence was committed by accident if the laser was being used professionally and all precautions had initially been taken to prevent an incident from occurring. the penalty will be imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. advancing the deterrent sends a clear message that laser misuse will not be tolerated. it has also been clarified that a laser beam could be a pulsed or continuous light, and it is defined in clause 3. the definition of the modes of transport to which the bill will apply has been extended, thanks to the work of my labour colleagues in the other place. the bill is an important piece of health and safety legislation to safeguard those who operate modes of transport from the effect of laser misuse.', 'five years is indeed the maximum sentence and the maximum fine is unlimited. the bill extends to the entire uk and will come into force in england, wales and scotland at the end of the period of two months beginning with the day on which the bill is passed. in northern ireland, aviation and shipping are reserved, and the provisions relating to those will come into force at the same time as in the rest of the uk. the bill is now in a better shape than when it was introduced. in particular, the creation of an offence for shining a laser at air traffic control has received widespread endorsement and is one that the government are happy to support. the bill has been a great example of the important role parliament has in strengthening legislation. i also thank those outside the chamber who have lent their expertise to this important bill. the uk laser working group, chaired by air commodore dai whittingham, the civil aviation authority, nats, the maritime and coastguard agency, the trade union the british airline pilots association, the national police air service and many others have provided invaluable advice on some very technical issues. our work in this area does not stop once the bill is passed. the bill specifically covers the risk posed by shining a laser at a person in control of a vehicle, but, as we discussed on second reading, the government have also announced new measures to tackle the sale of unsafe laser pointers. more than 150 incidents of eye injuries involving laser pointers have been reported since 2013, the vast majority of them involving children. in many of these cases, neither the children nor their parents have known the danger involved. the government will work to raise awareness of the risks associated with laser pointers, including among schoolchildren. in addition, the government have pledged extra support to local authority ports and border teams to stop high -

the fact that he will go after those who are not paying their tax and after those who use a digital platform and currently have an advantage over those who pay rates on the high street ; and the fact that small businesses will have greater rate relief. i am also pleased by some of the announcements about northern ireland. there is about a£1 billion of funding here for northern ireland."", ""two major issues act as a backdrop to the chancellor ' s budget. first is the prime minister ' s pledge that austerity is over, and it is worth remembering what she said : a€œa decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off. a€that is unequivocal. we expected to see the end of austerity made real today by the chancellor, if that is indeed the government ' s policy. secondly, unless they can be stopped by this house, tory brexit plans are likely to impose a massive economic shock on the uk, and the harder the brexit engineered by our government, the worse that shock will be. we have already lost 2 % to 2. 5 % of expected gdp growth over the past two years, according to the office for budget responsibility, because of the uncertainty created by brexit and the government ' s incompetence in dealing with it. the chancellor has dodged dealing with brexit uncertainties today by completely ignoring them and promising us an emergency budget in the spring if we crash out of the eu with no deal, as half his cabinet and the most hard - line brexit supporting members of his parliamentary party seek to make us do. as for the idea of ending austerity, what would such a budget look like? not like the budget we have just heard. to be fair to the chancellor, he said only that austerity is coming to an end. in other words, it will be going on for years to come. according to the institute for fiscal studies, the narrowest possible definition of a budget that ensures that austerity is over would require the chancellor to find an extra a£19 billion.""]"

a quorum demands 43, but president yameen announced the state of emergency extension regardless. the prosecutor general has publicly declared the state of emergency extension to be unconstitutional. despite the state of emergency and a 10. 30 pm curfew in mala©, daily anti - government protests have spread across the maldives and have now entered their fourth week."", ""i will certainly do so. i have rather long list of things to raise with the ambassador, but i will do my level best to ensure that that issue is discussed. the uk is also leading the international response, understandably. we helped to drive the eu foreign affairs council conclusions on 26 february, which called for the state of emergency to be lifted. the council announced that it would consider targeted measures if progress was not made. i also expect the uk to lead a statement of concern at the un human rights council in geneva later this week, as we did last june on behalf of more than 30 other countries. on human rights more broadly, the maldives has been one of the foreign office ' s human rights priority countries for several years. we have regularly raised our concerns about human rights, in particular the threatened re - imposition of the death penalty, with my maldivian counterparts, as have my government colleagues. we will continue to fund projects that support efforts by maldivian civil society to promote human rights, strengthen democratic institutions and advocate a greater role for women in public life. we are deeply concerned by reports of increasing radicalisation in the maldives and take them very seriously. we co - operate with the government of the maldives in the global fight against terrorism. our view is that open and pluralistic societies are better placed to combat the underlying drivers of radicalisation. my right hon. friend was right to point out that the decision by the maldives to leave the commonwealth in 2016 - an institution that was assisting it in addressing a number of these concerns - remains a source of deep sadness to us. we hope that in time the maldives will return to the commonwealth family by reapplying for membership, but clearly in its current state that cannot happen. my right hon. friend mentioned the safety of british visitors to the maldives, and many of them are there as we speak.""]"

they pay about a third more corporation tax proportionately than a non - bank corporation does. the second is through the bank levy. although the bank levy is being reduced, it will remain in force, so banks will continue to pay proportionately more tax than non - bank businesses after the implementation of this budget. that is a vital point to get across. the hon. gentleman also tried to link funding for children ' s services to the bank levy. in one of my interventions, i gave some figures on the total amount of tax that banks are paying. we can argue about why they are paying that extra tax. clearly, it is at least in part due to the surplus profits rate and to the bank levy. it may also, in part, be due to the fact that the banks ' profits have increased."", ""perhaps we can get into the nitty - gritty of this offline. the average revenue from the bank levy between its introduction in 2011 and 2015 - 16 was around a£2. 6 billion. as a result of this package, however, yield from the surcharge and the levy in 2022 - 23 is forecast to be a£3. 2 billion. by 2023, as i have said, we will have raised around a£44 billion in additional bank taxes since the 2010 election. opposition members have also suggested that our bank levy is set at a low level compared with other countries. in fact, not all financial centres have a bank levy. the usa, for example, chose not to introduce one at all, and while several eu countries introduced bank levies following the financial crisis, it is not possible to make direct comparisons between these levies as the rules for each are different. we have heard the argument this afternoon that we should reintroduce a tax on bankers ' pay. one of the aims of the changes to bank taxation announced in 2015 and 2016 is to ensure a sustainable long - term basis for taxing banks, based on taxing bank profits and the bank levy. by contrast, the bank payroll tax referred to in new clause 3 was always intended as a one - off tax. reintroducing it would be ineffective and unsustainable compared with the package of banking tax measures that we have introduced. even the last labour chancellor pointed out that it could not be repeated without significant tax avoidance. opposition members also propose that hmrc should publish a register of tax paid by individual banks under the levy. taxpayer confidentiality is rightly a core principle for trust in our tax system and hmrc does not publish details of the amount of tax paid by any individual business.""]"

often unknowingly - rely every day. as my right hon. friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster set out yesterday, the word a€œappropriatea€ was chosen carefully to ensure that the government have the discretion called for by this unique situation. the constraints that a test of necessity would impose would prevent the government and the devolved administrations from making the best corrections to ensure that the statute book continues to function properly."", 'i cannot give way, because i really must press on. we are committed to proper scrutiny and engagement with parliament and the public on our corrections to eu law and future changes. in addition to all the changes we have already made to the bill, there will be a presumption in favour of engagement or consultation where it is proportionate and sensible to do so. of course, departments will consult where there is a statutory duty to do so. departments across whitehall have already undertaken engagement or consultation with stakeholders for active discussions on areas where that has been proportionate and sensible, and that will only increase. most of those who have supported lords amendment 4 are well intentioned, but some must have known that it would have hugely detrimental effects on how we could deliver a functioning statute book ahead of our exit and in the future. instead of protecting the law in the crucial areas of employment, equality, health, consumer standards and environmental protection, it would weaken it. by calling this amendment a€œenhanced protectiona€, some are seeking to hide a great danger. by limiting the changes that delegated powers could make to retained eu law relating to the specified policy areas to only those that are deemed technical, the amendment would fundamentally limit our ability to properly correct deficiencies. that risks dramatically increasing the amount of primary legislation that needs to be enacted ahead of our exit, putting more pressure on this place ahead of brexit. even the changes deemed to be a€œtechnicala€ enough to be achieved through delegated powers would still face a lengthy enhanced scrutiny process, which the lords could force to be as long as the 18 months required for legislative and regulatory reform orders. in other words, our statute book could not be made ready for exit by 29 march 2019.', ""the situation is set out in detail in the written ministerial statement that we laid. both houses will have meaningful votes on whether to accept the agreement. it is my expectation that we would not ratify before that primary legislation has gone through. new clause 1 was tabled by the labour front - bench team. it seeks to place limitations on the use of existing and future powers to amend and modify retained eu law. it is absolutely right and necessary for existing domestic powers granted by parliament in other acts and any future delegated powers created after exit day to be able to operate effectively and without inappropriate fetter within uk domestic law after our departure from the eu. this includes parts of our existing domestic law which will become retained eu law after exit day, as well as retained direct eu legislation which will be converted into our domestic statute book. the bill ' s current approach to existing and future delegated powers aims to ensure the successful operation of retained eu law within our domestic statute book beyond the time limits for the bill ' s more limited specific powers. adopting the new clause, on the other hand, would undermine the position of certainty and have several detrimental effects that would risk creating significant confusion in the uk statute book. first, limiting the modification of retained eu law by existing and future delegated powers only to when this is necessarya€œto maintain or enhance rights and protectionsa€could have uncertain consequences. a test of necessity would impose a high burden that may prevent powers from being used in the most appropriate and relevant way if the regulations they create are not deemed truly necessary for the protection of rights. that could mean that existing and future delegated powers would be unable to amend or modify irrelevant or unsuitable parts of the statute book, leading to ossification of parts of retained eu law within uk domestic law and creating confusion and uncertainty.""]"

chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on liver health. i have been the chairman now for some 13 years - simply because i do not think anyone else wants to take on the mantle, to be frank. when we set up our all - party parliamentary group, we looked for a celebrity to head it all, as one does, and we chose george best. the house might feel that george best was an unlikely person to head up the charity, but at that time he was a reformed character, and he did a lot of good in those early years. unfortunately, as we all know, a great toll was taken on his health and, sadly, he died. we then looked for another celebrity, and - what a joy - anita roddick of the body shop, who was a wonderful and remarkable lady, became our patron. she died in 2007. the house may know that she contracted hepatitis c from a blood transfusion in 1971 and was unaware that she was living with the disease until 2004. a routine blood test revealed the diagnosis. she was a tireless campaigner, and we owe her a great debt of gratitude, but since 2007 we have struggled to find a patron to head up the organisation as president. if colleagues have any ideas, i know our appg would be glad to hear from them.', 'of course, the hon. lady states a fact not an opinion, and i accept that, which is why i speak of the importance of primary care and of making every contact count. the people who portmans pharmacy interacts with are not all sick. people who have a hepatitis c infection or a drug - use issue have other issues - they get flu too - so they interact with that pharmacy, and the pharmacy makes every contact count by grabbing people earlier. that is one reason why i am so passionate about the way that that underused network can help us to reach the ambitious targets that we have set. everyone has rightly talked about prevention - in many ways, i am the minister with responsibility for prevention and it is the thing that i am most passionate about in our health service. as well as testing and treating those already infected, an essential part of tackling hepatitis c must be the prevention of infection in the first place, or the prevention of reinfection of those successfully treated, which would not be a smart use of public resources. nhs england and public health england, which i have direct ministerial responsibility for, are actively engaged in programmes at a local level to prevent the spread of infection. as people who inject drugs or share needles are at the greatest risk of acquiring hepatitis c, prevention services, particularly those provided by drug treatment centres, are key components of hepatitis c control strategies. clearly, the key to breaking the cycle of hepatitis c is to prevent infection happening in the first place.', ""it is genuinely a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, mr streeter, and to be back in westminster hall on such a quiet day in westminster. the hon. member for ealing, southall ( mr sharma ) is sadly not in his place today, but i thank my hon. friend the member for southend west ( sir david amess ) for securing and leading this debate. although he said that he was not the best person to introduce the debate, he could have fooled us because he did it very well. hepatitis c is a significant health issue in our country, and for too long it has been overshadowed by other public health concerns that, despite the superstars involved, have had higher public profiles. i pay tribute to the hepatitis c trust and the wonderful charles gore, whom i have got to know in this job. he is a colossus in this area, and has become a friend. i also thank the hepatitis c coalition - this issue has been central to both those organisations. my hon. friend mentioned lots of local services for southend residents, and a lot is going on in his constituency. few mps champion their constituency more than he does, so for his press release i will mention that screening and onward referral services are provided by the southend treatment and recovery service, known as stars. for primary care, gp practices refer people to the specialist treatment services in my hon. friend ' s much -

run housing association in the city. it has improved the quality of life for many glaswegians over the years. michael epitomised all that was good about the labour movement and the opportunity that it has afforded for the advancement of working - class people over the last century. he inspired many local young people into a vocation in politics. i have been particularly moved by the number of constituents who have contacted me in the past couple of days to express their gratitude for the help that michael provided to their family or to their neighbours. to this day, on every single street in my constituency, michael is fondly remembered, even though he never sought any great recognition for his efforts. he often referred to the lesson in the gospel of st luke about jesus healing 10 lepers, but only one coming back to thank him. michael sought to help people humbly, quietly and without any need for praise.', ""on behalf of her majesty ' s government, i join you, mr speaker, in expressing our sadness at the death on sunday of the former house of commons speaker, michael martin - latterly, lord martin of springburn. as we remember his life and contribution to this place today, the thoughts and prayers of the whole house will be with his family and friends. first elected to the house of commons for the seat of glasgow, springburn in 1979, michael martin was dedicated to the people of glasgow. he was a proud scotsman who never forgot his roots, and some members, including my right hon. friend the secretary of state for scotland, experienced his bagpipes playing at his annual burns night supper, which i gather was something of a special event. he demonstrated that pride during his time as a back - bench member, during his spell as parliamentary private secretary to denis healey between 1981 and 1983 and, of course, during his time as a cross - bench peer in the other place. as a back - bench member, in addition to representing his constituents in glasgow, michael martin was a member of the trade and industry committee between 1983 and 1987. in 1987 he became first deputy chairman of ways and means, and he was elected to the position of speaker in october 2000. in the debate before his election, he said : a€œmy apprenticeship has been one of serving the house as a chairman of standing committees, the administration committee and the scottish grand committee. i have never sought to be a whip, a front - bench spokesman or a minister... i have enjoyed defending the rights of the house. a€ - michael martin served as speaker for almost nine years. he was introduced to the house of lords in august 2009, where he was an active cross -

stricken background he ended up as the first catholic speaker, in one of the most senior posts in public life. michael martin worked as a sheet metal worker at rolls royce, and then as a full - time organiser for the national union of public employees - nupe. there he met another union organiser who ended up as leader of the opposition. he entered parliament in 1979 for glasgow, springburn and then for glasgow north east, serving this place for 30 years. he was a member of numerous committees and he clearly knew how this place worked. when elected speaker, he sat in the chair without tights - as you said, mr speaker - a practice for speakers he abolished. he started his tenure by holding a press conference - a very progressive move. he also served in the other place from 2009 - nearly 40 years of public service. you mentioned michael ' s kindness : a member told me how anyone from a working - class background was always shown support so that they did not feel out of place in parliament. a member of staff, who was also from a glasgow housing estate, told me how michael wrote to her mother saying how proud she should be of her daughter ' s contribution in parliament. to michael ' s wife mary, his son paul, his daughter mary ann and his family, we send our condolences at this difficult time.""]"

as i said, passenger journeys have increased by 42 % on competitive lines, compared with 27 % on those that have no competition ; revenue has increased by 57 %, compared with 48 % ; and average fares have increased by only 11 %, compared with 17 %. the east coast main line has open access operators such as grand central trains and hull trains. other rail lines around the country would do well to replicate that model. open access operators take no support from the taxpayer. the open access model creates competition on the line, which has led to fantastic results. in fact, since that has been the case on the east coast, the main line has had the highest satisfaction ratings in the country. the east coast open access operators deliver the very highest rates : in 2015 first hull trains and grand central each had a 94 % passenger satisfaction rate, which was the joint highest score of all operators. that was confirmed in 2016 and 2017 in the passenger satisfaction surveys conducted by the competition and markets authority. in 2016, the cma recommended more on - track competition generally, either with much more open access to compete with franchises on the same lines or with multiple operators to provide services in a fully commercial environment. unlike the cma, however, the government are yet formally to declare their support for the principle of extended open access. perhaps the minister will take up the offer to do so this afternoon. open access competition has led to new routes being opened or reopened. without open access on the east coast main line, would places such as sunderland, hartlepool, halifax and bradford have the frequent, direct and high - speed long - distance services from which they now benefit?

a€ well, i am a person of faith, and i must say that it can sometimes be quite fragile - it can be difficult to retain that faith in the modern world - but part of being a person of faith is also about recognising and respecting no faith. many people feel that marriage perhaps has religious connotations that they do not wish to enter into. marriage is also expensive. it can be a huge undertaking at a time of student debts and other financial difficulties for young people embarking on life together, or for people of any age, to take on what can often be a crippling expense. people may also have different experiences of marriage. they may have seen their parents married or perhaps been married themselves, and they may have seen that marriage did not work for their parents or for themselves."", ""my hon. friend is impatient. i will confirm that later in my speech : there is plenty more to come. my hon. friend got in first, but it was not really necessary. i am aware that i have majored on the first of the four parts of the bill. it has three other important components, which i think are less complicated and hopefully less contentious. the fact that my late mother could not add her name as a parent on my marriage certificate is an anachronism, well past its sell - by date and, frankly, an outrage. in fact, the signatures of both my mother and my mother - in - law were included on our marriage certificate, but at our discretion, and as the signatures of witnesses rather than parents. my father signed, as did my wife ' s father, because in the days when the anomaly originated, a daughter was a father ' s chattel for him to give away, and literally sign away. that has been the case in england since 1837, the beginning of queen victoria ' s reign, and has not changed since then. the problem apparently lies with the current system of marriage registration, which relies on hard - copy register books held in churches and other religious establishments as well as register offices. that involves some 84, 000 open register books in 30, 000 churches and religious buildings, so it is quite a big undertaking. surely, in this digital age, it is not beyond the wit of man or woman to introduce a single electronic register instead of relying on hard - copy books. that would avoid the potentially costly need to replace all the register books. instead of signing a book at the ceremony, the newly married couple would sign a document that would then be returned to the register office to be entered in the existing electronic register so that an official marriage certificate could be issued, including the names of all the parents."", ""i am pleased to follow my hon. friend the member for faversham and mid kent ( helen whately ) and to have heard her passionate words, particularly about stable partnerships and her experiences in the nhs. i am delighted to support the bill of my hon. friend the member for east worthing and shoreham ( tim loughton ). it is a short but packed bill that deals with life and death and everything in between, including a lot of loving. it is therefore a very worthy bill, and i want to turn first to the point about mothers ' names on marriage certificates. i have been married for 29 years, and think a medal is in order - although i am not sure whether it should be given to me or my husband. the whole concept of making a commitment and marrying somebody was a very big decision, and our wedding day was a most momentous day, and our union is forever recorded on our marriage certificate. but currently on our precious marriage certificate there is no reference to my poor mother at all, even though she bore me and virtually died - something she has never stopped reminding me of since. i tell her i was trying to make my presence felt at a very early stage. similarly, when my two daughters get married - if they do - as the law stands, my name will not be on the marriage certificate. one might reflect that that is of no particular consequence, but as my hon. friend the member for erewash ( maggie throup ) pointed out, genealogists and others interested in tracing their family history or the social history of women will be unable to find this kind of information because it is not recorded. that is a great pity, especially as so much progress has been made on women ' s equality.""]"

all entwine with one another to deliver something that is quite exciting, not just from an industrial and economic perspective, but from a social perspective and in terms of how our communities and the future economy will operate. within that are the sector deals. it is right that the government are seeking to reinforce the success of current industries that have done well for the uk, such as defence and aerospace and nuclear, and looking to use these sector deals to incubate our future economy too. to be clear, in putting together this industrial strategy, focusing on the areas as it does and in looking over the horizon - while not, i suspect, trying to pick winners but trying to understand what is likely to be the bedrock of a future economy - the government must use the industrial strategy and everything around it to facilitate disruption as much as they can. i say that because, again and again, we see that the new businesses that really change the way we live, drive down costs for consumers and drive up customer service are the ones that have come in and disrupted old and lazy industries. these industries, often underpinned by exciting advances in automation, artificial intelligence and tech, are exactly the things we have the opportunity, through good policy making in the next few years, to unleash to the benefit of uk consumers.""]"
